/**
 *  A collection of MediaWiki/Wikimedia related utilities, including a rather
 *  sketchy bot framework that consists of only one file.
 *
 *  <p>
 *  This package does not, and will not, have any dependencies outside of the
 *  core JDK. Only the java.base and java.logging modules are required.
 *
 *  <p>
 *  All methods should work on a vanilla installation of MediaWiki with the 
 *  exception of {@link WMFWiki}. Required extension(s) for any given method 
 *  are denoted in the documentation.
