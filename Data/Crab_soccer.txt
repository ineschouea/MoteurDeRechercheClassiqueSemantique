'''Crab soccer''' ([[List of American words not widely used in the United Kingdom#S|American English]] and [[Australian English]]), or '''crab football''' ([[British English]]), is an informal [[sport]] played by two teams. The objective is to kick an inflated ball into a [[Goal (sport)|goal]] to score points. The game is commonly played in [[Physical education]] classes. The game can be played with a regular [[soccer ball]], but is often played with a [[cage ball]].<ref>[[Physical_education|Physical Education]]</ref>  At the end of the game, the team with the most points wins. Unlike [[Association football|soccer]], players support themselves on their hands and move with their feet, in motions that make them look like [[crab]]s,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scoutbase.org.uk/direct/games/index.php?ID=64 |title=Home page - ScoutBase UK |publisher=Scoutbase.org.uk |date=2013-01-31 |accessdate=2014-04-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050927024152/http://www.scoutbase.org.uk/direct/games/index.php?ID=64 |archive-date=2005-09-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://pbskids.org/zoom/activities/games/crabsoccer.html |title=ZOOM . activities . games .

There are various sets of rules. This sport involves [[kick]]ing, so [[safety]] is at the root of many rules. Like soccer, players other than the [[goalkeeper]] must not touch the ball with their [[hands]]. No players may stand except for the [[Goalkeeper|goalies]].

In some versions of the game, the player's posterior is supported by a small wheeled platform in which they scoot around with their hands and legs.
