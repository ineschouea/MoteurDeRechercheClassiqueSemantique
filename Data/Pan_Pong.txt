=== Court ===

Pan-pon is played on a rectangular flat court, normally outdoors on asphalt alternatively indoors on plastic floor.
The court is 7 x 2.5 m with an inner serve area of 5.5 x 1 meter. The net is made of a 3-meter wooden plank, placed 40&nbsp;cm above ground.

=== Equipment ===

Pans from the kitchen are made of wood, 30 x 20&nbsp;cm and ca 10&nbsp;mm in thickness. A simple ledge can be mounted on one of the short sides to make it easier to hold.

The ball is an air-pumped rubber ball, size like a tennis ball (ca 70&nbsp;mm diameter). If the ball is dropped from 1 meter altitude it should bounce back up 50–60&nbsp;cm if it is correctly pumped.

The receiver will hit the ball back into the servers court side.

=== Scoring ===

A game consists of a sequence of points played with the same player serving. The game is won by the first player to have won at least four points in total. If the score is 3-3 it is necessary to win with two points. At 4-4 it is enough to win with one point.

=== Serve ===

The serve is alternated between the players, point by point. The server must stand behind the base line and between the side lines. The receiver can stand at any place in the court. It is not allowed to hit the serve with the racket above the waist. The server only has one attempt to make a successful serve. The receiver is not allowed to hit the ball before it has touched the ground.
