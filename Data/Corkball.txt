It has many of the features of baseball, yet can be played in a very small area because there is no base-running.<ref>{{cite news|last=Pierce|first=Charles P.|url=http://www.esquire.com/sports/a1046/sport-time-forgot-0600/|title=The Sport That Time Forgot|work=[[Esquire Magazine]]|date=June 1, 2000|accessdate=2009-08-13}}</ref>

==Game play==
Corkball uses a {{convert|1.6|oz|g|adj=on}} ball, which is stitched and resembles a baseball.  The bat has a barrel that measures up to {{convert|1.5|in|cm}} in diameter and a maximum of {{convert|38|in|cm}} in length. Playing fields are traditionally {{convert|30|ft|m}} in width and {{convert|250|ft|m}} in length. Different measurements are paced off to determine hits. A batter must hit the ball at least {{convert|15|ft|m}} in order to register a hit. Any hit between {{convert|15|ft|m}} and {{convert|150|ft|m}} is a single, up to {{convert|200|ft|m}} is a double, up to {{convert|250|ft|m}} is a triple and beyond {{convert|250|ft|m}} is a home run. Measurements can be modified based on available conditions. Baserunning is non existent due to the measured hits. Teams have a minimum of two players (pitcher and catcher) and a maximum of five players on the field at a time. Fielders may wear baseball gloves but are not required to. The catcher must wear a catcher's mask while behind the plate. Pitching rubber and home plate are the same as used in baseball. "Runners" advance as many bases as the batter gets on the hit. If a runner is on first and the batter hits a double, then the resulting runners will be on second and third. If a runner is on first and the batter hits a single, then it will be first and second.
