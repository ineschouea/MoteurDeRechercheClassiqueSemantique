'''''Alveopora spongiosa''''' is a species of [[Scleractinia|stony coral]] that is found in the [[Red Sea]], the [[Gulf of Aden]], the southwest and northern Indian Ocean, the central [[Indo-Pacific]], Australia, Southeast Asia Japan, the [[East China Sea]] and the oceanic west and central Pacific Ocean. It can be found on protected upper [[coral reef]] slopes, generally from depth of 9–20&nbsp;m, but can grow at depths of up to 50&nbsp;m. It is moderately susceptible to [[coral bleaching]], and is harvested for the aquarium trade.

==Description==
[[Colony (biology)|Colonies]] of ''Alveopora spongiosa'' take various forms; they may be submassive plates or cushions, or be columnar or encrusting, sometimes reaching a diameter of {{convert|2|m|ft|-1}}. The  [[Septum (coral)|septa]] on the [[corallite]] walls bear slender tapering spines of various lengths which do not connect together. The polyps may have two whorls of knobbed [[tentacle]]s, six long ones and six short. The colonies are usually some shade of brown, sometimes with white tips to the tentacles.<ref name=AIMS>{{cite web |url=http://coral.aims.gov.au/factsheet.jsp?speciesCode=0086 |title=''Alveopora spongiosa'' |year=2013 |publisher=Australian Institute of Marine Science |accessdate=7 August 2015}}</ref>

==Biology==
''Alveopora spongiosa'' is a [[Zooxanthellae|zooxanthellate]] species of coral.<ref name=WoRMS/> It obtains most of its nutritional needs from the [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]] [[dinoflagellate]]s that live inside its soft tissues. These [[Photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] organisms provide the coral with organic carbon and nitrogen, sometimes providing up to 90% of their host's energy needs for metabolism and growth. Its remaining needs are met by the [[plankton]]ic organisms caught by the tentacles of the polyps.<ref name=Ruppert>{{cite book |title=Invertebrate Zoology |edition=7th |last1=Ruppert |first1=Edward E. |last2=Fox |first2=Richard, S. |last3=Barnes |first3=Robert D. |year=2004 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=978-81-315-0104-7 |page=122 }}</ref>

==Status==
This coral is moderately susceptible to [[coral bleaching]] but less so than related species that occur in shallower water. It is an attractive small coral and is collected by the [[reef aquarium]] trade.  All corals receive protection by being listed on [[CITES Appendix II]]. The main threats faced by corals are related to [[climate change]]; the mechanical destruction of their coral reef habitats, increasing damage from extreme weather events, rising sea water temperatures and [[ocean acidification]]. It has a wide range and is locally common, and the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] has assessed the conservation status of this species as being "[[Near-threatened species|near-threatened]]".<ref name=iucn/>
