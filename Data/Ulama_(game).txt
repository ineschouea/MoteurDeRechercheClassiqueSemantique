'''Ulama''' ({{IPA-es|u?lama|}}) is a ball game played in a few communities in the [[Mexican states|Mexican state]] of [[Sinaloa]]. Descended from the [[Aztec]] version of the [[Mesoamerican ballgame]],<ref>Leyenaar (2001) p. 123.</ref> the game is one of the oldest continuously played sports in the world and is notable for the fact that it is the oldest known game using a rubber [[ball]].

==History==
{{Main|Mesoamerican ballgame}}
The word ''ulama'' comes from the [[Nahuatl]] word  ''?llamaliztli'' {{IPA-nah|o?l?ama?list?i|}} a combination of ''?llamas'' {{IPA-nah|?o?l?ama|}} (playing of a game with a ball) and ''?llei'' {{IPA-nah|?o?l?i|}} (rubber).  ''?llamaliztli'' was the Aztec name for the Mesoamerican ballgame, whose roots extended back to at least the 2nd millennium [[Before Christ|BC]] and evidence of which has been found in nearly all [[Mesoamerica]]n cultures in an area extending from modern-day [[Mexico]] to [[El Salvador]], and possibly in modern-day [[Arizona]] and [[New Mexico]].<ref name="FOX">Fox, John. [https://books.google.com/books?id=LD6h3NHeHxgC&printsec=frontcover ''The ball : discovering the object of the game''], 1st ed., New York : Harper, 2012. {{ISBN|978-0-06-188179-4}}. Cf. Chapter 4: "Sudden Death in the New World" about the Ulama game.</ref> Archaeologists have uncovered rubber balls dating to at least 1600 BC,<ref>See [[El Manati]] article for information on recovery of the earliest rubber balls.</ref> ballgamer figures from at least 1200 BC, and nearly 1500 ancient ball courts.<ref name="FOX"/><ref>Taladoire counts 1560 courts discovered as of the year 2000, p. 98.</ref>

However, due to its religious and ritual aspects, [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Roman Catholicism|Catholics]] suppressed the game soon after the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Spanish conquest]], leaving it to survive in areas such as [[Sinaloa]], where Spanish influence was less pervasive.<ref>Leyenaar (2001) p. 128.</ref>

==Ulama==
Ulama games are played on a temporary court called a ''tastei'' ({{IPA-all|tas.te|}}, from ''tlachtli'' {{IPA-nah|?t??at??t??i|}}, the Nahuatl word meaning "ballcourt").  The bounds of these long narrow courts are made by drawing or [[chalk]]ing thick lines in the dirt. The courts are divided into opposing sides by a center line, called an ''analco''. A ball that is allowed to cross the end line, the ''chichi'' or ''chivo'', will result in a point for the opposing team. Points or ''rayas'' ("lines", so named for the [[tally marks]] used to keep score) are gained in play. The scoring system provides for resetting the score to zero in certain conditions, which can make for lengthy games.

The modern-day game has three main forms:

*''Ulama de cadera'' or hip ulama. A hip ulama team consists of five or more players (but there could be as many as twelve) wearing loincloths, with leather hip pads for some protection against the heavy (3&nbsp;kg, around 7&nbsp;lb) rubber ball.  
*''Ulama de antebrazo'' or forearm ulama. Played on a smaller field, with teams of one to three players and a ball lighter than that of hip ulama, the games requires the players to return the ball using their wrapped forearm.<ref>For a more indepth look at hip ulama and forearm ulama, see Leyenaar (2001).</ref> Women often play this game.
*''Ulama de mazo'' or ''Ulama de palo'', in which a heavy (6–7&nbsp;kg or 13-15&nbsp;lb) two-handed wooden paddle strikes a 500 g (1&nbsp;lb) ball, usually with teams of three or four.<ref>Federación Mexicana de Juegos y Deportes Autóctonos y Tradicionales, A.C.</ref>

The object of the game is to keep the ball in play and in bounds. Depending on the score &mdash; and the local variant of the rules &mdash; the ball is played either high or low. A team scores a point when a player of the opposing team hits the ball out of turn; misses the ball; knocks the ball out of bounds; touches the ball with their hands or some other body part aside from the hip; accidentally touches a teammate; lets the ball stop moving before it reaches the centre line or even if they fail to announce the score after they have scored a point.

The first team that scores eight points wins. If both teams end up having the same number of points after a turn, both sides begin again from zero. One record-setting game reportedly lasted for eight days,{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} but most modern games are stopped after about two hours.
