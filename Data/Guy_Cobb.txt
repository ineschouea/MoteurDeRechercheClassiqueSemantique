'''Guy Franke Cobb''' (born October 27, 1963) is an American artist born in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], United States.

==Career==
In 1983 Cobb left the [[University of Mississippi]] to join his older brother, Ty Cobb, as a co-founder of an acrobatic basketball show called the [[Bud Light Daredevils]].  The group entertained audiences at NBA and college basketball games in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia.<ref name="storysouth.com">Gill, William [http://www.storysouth.com/summer2004/guycobbsarticle.html "Imitating Art: Guy Cobb, Shelby Farms, and the Distillation of Life and Place"] ''storySouth'', Summer 2004, Retrieved 2 September 2010</ref>
[[File:Guy Cobb Thorn Painting.jpg|thumb|left|175px|"Thorn Painting" by Cobb]]
By 1990 Cobb had relocated to rural [[Fair Grove, Missouri]]<ref name="storysouth.com"/>  where he was inspired by a documentary of [[Jackson Pollock]] and began working with sheet metal and locust tree thorns.  His first painting titled, ''Down in the Valley of Rural Violence'' was an examination of the 1987 James Schnick massacre at [[Elkland, Missouri]].<ref name="storysouth.com"/>

In 1993 Cobb moved to Memphis and began painting again.

===Reception===
Art critics John Simmons and Camille Howell wrote: "Down in the Valley of Rural Violence is typical of what Cobb calls his 'thorn paintings'.....His use of tortured metal, abstract forms and an overlay of projecting thorns all combine in this and the other paintings in the series to produce statements of anger and frustration". "Guy Cobb is an artist worth watching. He could well become a real force on the regional art scene."<ref>Simmons, John, "Artist depicts violence with sheet metal, shotguns" (May 8, 1992), ''Springfield News Leader''</ref> "Cobb's works are unsettling, disquieting, and impossible to ignore."<ref>Howell, Camille, "Nature drawings look dug from the ground" (February 21, 1992), ''Springfield News Leader''</ref>
