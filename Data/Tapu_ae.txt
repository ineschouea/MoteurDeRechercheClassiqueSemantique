'''Tapu ae''' (also known as '''Tapuwai''' and '''Tapuwae''') is a traditional [[M?ori people|M?ori]] ball game. It is an adaptation of [[ki-o-rahi]] to a court game, and was formalised about 1900. Today it is played on a hard surface such as a [[netball]] court. The court consists of two sides where players pass the ball aiming to knock the block in the middle of the two sides over.
