The '''Paraguayan fat-tailed mouse opossum''' (''Thylamys macrurus'') is a species of [[opossum]] in the family [[Didelphidae]]. It is found in forested areas of [[Brazil]] and [[Paraguay]].<ref name=iucn/> It is known only from a few specimens. For two listed specimens, one had a head-and-body length of about 135&nbsp;mm and a tail length of about 140&nbsp;mm, while the other had a head-and-body length of about 120&nbsp;mm and a tail length of about 155&nbsp;mm. Most of its [[fur]] is gray, but the shoulder areas are reddish gray, and the [[Anatomical terms of location|ventral]] [[fur]] is pure white or creamy white. There is also a ring of black fur surrounding each [[eye]]. The [[Anatomical terms of location|ventral]] surface of the tail is white. The [[Dorsum (biology)|dorsal]] surface of the tail is gray for the first one third to one half of its length (going from the base to the tip); the remainder of the [[Dorsum (biology)|dorsal]] surface of the tail is white. The tail is hairless except for about its first ten mm (going from the base to the tip).<ref name = "Eisenberg">{{Cite book
