'''''Acanthastrea rotundoflora''''' is a species of [[coral]] found in [[Indo-Pacific]] waters from the [[Red Sea]] to Australia and the [[East China Sea]]. The species in uncommon throughout its range, and is threatened by the global loss of [[coral reef]] habitats.

==Description==
[[Colony (biology)|Colonies]] of ''Acanthastrea rotundoflora'' are either massive or encrusting. The [[corallite]]s are plocoid and rather widely separated, and in small colonies there is a conspicuous central corallite. The [[Septum (coral)|septa]] have long pointed teeth. The general colour of this coral is rusty-brown, dark brown or green.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://coral.aims.gov.au/factsheet.jsp?speciesCode=0384 |title=''Acanthastrea rotundoflora''|publisher=Australian Institute of Marine Science |accessdate=2015-08-15}}</ref>

==Biology==
''Acanthastrea rotundoflora'' is a [[Zooxanthellae|zooxanthellate]] species of coral.<ref name=WoRMS/> It obtains most of its nutritional needs from the [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]] [[dinoflagellate]]s that live inside its soft tissues. These [[Photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] organisms provide the coral with organic carbon and nitrogen, sometimes providing up to 90% of their host's energy needs for metabolism and growth. Its remaining needs are met by the [[plankton]]ic organisms caught by the tentacles of the polyps.<ref name=Ruppert>{{cite book |title=Invertebrate Zoology |edition=7th |last1=Ruppert |first1=Edward E. |last2=Fox |first2=Richard, S. |last3=Barnes |first3=Robert D. |year=2004 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=978-81-315-0104-7 |page=122 }}</ref>

==Status==
This coral has a wide range and is moderately common. It is less susceptible to [[coral bleaching]] than some related species because it occurs in deeper water. The population trend for this species is unclear, but the main threats faced by corals in general are related to [[climate change]] and the mechanical destruction of their coral reef habitats; increasing damage from extreme weather events, rising sea water temperatures and [[ocean acidification]]. The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] has assessed the conservation status of this species as being a "[[near-threatened species]]". All corals receive protection by being listed on [[CITES Appendix II]].<ref name=iucn/>
