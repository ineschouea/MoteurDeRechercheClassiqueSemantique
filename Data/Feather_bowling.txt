The balls are rolled down a trough shaped dirt or synthetic alley towards a feather sticking out opposite ends of the lane. The object of the game is to get the ball as close to the feather as possible. Teams take turns rolling 12 balls (6 for each team) and may knock their opponent's balls out of the way, similar to [[Bocce]]. The team with balls closest to the feather at the end of the round wins 1 point per ball. The game is over when one team scores 10 points.
