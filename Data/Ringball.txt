== Gameplay ==
Ringball is a non-contact sport<ref>http://www.topendsports.com/sport/more/ringball.htm</ref> played by both men and women teams in separate games. It is similar to the game of [[netball]] and can be played on an all weather, grass, or in-door [[#The Court|court]].  The court is divided into three sections. A team consists of three goal scorers, three centre players, and three defending players. The objective of the game is to throw the ball from one player to another and finally through the ring or hoop of the goalpost.  A goalpost is placed at both ends of the court.[[File:Ringball_starting_positions.jpg|thumb|right|upright=2.0|Starting positions of players on a Ringball court. The red player in the [[semicircle]] holds the ball.]]

The South African game of ringball is played by two opposing teams consisting of nine (9) players on a side. Three players of each team play in each of the three sections of the court (three (3) goal shooters, three (3) centre players and three (3) defenders).  These players may at no time during play, touch ground in any adjacent section, step on or receive the ball over the lines separating the sections.

The ball is passed through the air from player to player and is caught with the hands, such that the ball does not touch any other part of the body.  In passing the ball, a player may not move forward or backward, feint a pass, or be in possession of the ball for longer than two (2) seconds during the attempt to pass the ball.

To [[Ringball#The Score|score]], the ball must fall through the ring from above.  A goal shooter may attempt to score a goal from any position in the goal section and outside the [[semicircle]].  Both hands (from below upwards) must be used when shooting a goal and must be attempted within five (5) seconds from the time the ball is received.  When a penalty goal has been awarded, any of the three opposing goal shooters can attempt a goal from any position outside the goal circle.  A penalty goal must be attempted within three (3) seconds.  A goal shooter can also attempt a penalty from behind the penalty line within three (3) seconds.

Players may try to gain possession of the ball without hitting or snatching the ball from the opponent's hands.  Players are not allowed to hold, push away or obstruct their opponents in any manner to prevent them from passing the ball.  Two (2) players of the same team may not touch or hold the ball simultaneously.  It is an infringement if the ball crosses the section without being touched by a player in that section.

When players of both teams commit a transgression simultaneously, it is called a double fault.  The referee then tosses the ball into the air between two opposing players where the transgressions occurred.  The two opposing players then attempt to gain possession of the ball by hitting or catching the ball on the descend.

A match consists of two-halves of 25 minutes each with an interval of three (3) minutes.  After each successful goal, the players must take up position as shown on the image.  The centre player stands in the half circle facing his own goalpost.  At the blow of the whistle the ball must be passed to one of the wings within two (2) seconds.  It is an infringement when the ball is passed to another section without passing to a wing first.

When the ball goes out of play crossing the outside lines, an opposing player from that section puts the ball into play on the spot where it has left the court.

The team with the highest score at the end of the match is the winning team.

== Rules ==

===The Court===

1.	The court<ref>Ringball South Africa – Rules of the game, updated April 2016.  Approved AGM 2015</ref> is 27 m x 18 m in size and is divided into three (3) equal sections (9 m x 18 m).  The two goalposts are situated in the middle of each short side of the court against the outside line.  Each goalpost has a steel ring of 450mm in diameter attached at the top, exactly 3 m from the ground.  With the goalpost as pivot a half circle (the goal circle) with a radius of 4,5 m is drawn.  The penalty line is short line in the goal section 1 m in length and 2 m from the middle inside line directly in line with the middle half circles. The two side sections are called the goal sections and the middle section is called the centre section.  Exactly in the middle of the centre section, a circle of 1 m diameter and in the middle of the two inside lines, two half circles with a diameter of 1 m are drawn.  On either side of the centre circle two "V”-lines with legs of 1 m long are drawn and this is referred to as the "V”. See the diagram below for the position of the goalposts.

[[File:Ringball court layout.jpg|thumb|upright=2.0|The image indicates the markings on a ringball court for the purpose of discussing the gameplay.]]

2.	All-weather, gravel or grass courts, or adapted netball courts may be used.  The surface of the court must be even.  Gravel courts must be free of grass and must be well compacted.  Slip-free all-weather courts are recommended.  Netball courts can be used with minor adjustments.

3.	Within a distance of 1,5 m around the court there should be no obstacles such as trees, light poles, walls, fences, wires or steps (also see the [[Ringball#Spectators|spectators]] section).

4.	All lines must be clearly marked in white or yellow.  The width of these lines should be between 25&nbsp;mm and 50&nbsp;mm.

5.	The goalposts must be of 3 m circular steel pipes with a diameter of 75 – 90&nbsp;mm.  The goalposts must be placed in a vertical position in the centre of the 18 m outside line.  The inside edge of the goal post must form a tangent with the inside edge of the line.

6.	The ring on the goalpost must be of a sturdy round metal bar with a maximum of 18&nbsp;mm thickness and an inside diameter of 350&nbsp;mm.  Flat steel rings are not allowed.

== Gameplay ==
Ringball is a non-contact sport<ref>http://www.topendsports.com/sport/more/ringball.htm</ref> played by both men and women teams in separate games. It is similar to the game of [[netball]] and can be played on an all weather, grass, or in-door [[#The Court|court]].  The court is divided into three sections. A team consists of three goal scorers, three centre players, and three defending players. The objective of the game is to throw the ball from one player to another and finally through the ring or hoop of the goalpost.  A goalpost is placed at both ends of the court.[[File:Ringball_starting_positions.jpg|thumb|right|upright=2.0|Starting positions of players on a Ringball court. The red player in the [[semicircle]] holds the ball.]]

The South African game of ringball is played by two opposing teams consisting of nine (9) players on a side. Three players of each team play in each of the three sections of the court (three (3) goal shooters, three (3) centre players and three (3) defenders).  These players may at no time during play, touch ground in any adjacent section, step on or receive the ball over the lines separating the sections.

The ball is passed through the air from player to player and is caught with the hands, such that the ball does not touch any other part of the body.  In passing the ball, a player may not move forward or backward, feint a pass, or be in possession of the ball for longer than two (2) seconds during the attempt to pass the ball.

To [[Ringball#The Score|score]], the ball must fall through the ring from above.  A goal shooter may attempt to score a goal from any position in the goal section and outside the [[semicircle]].  Both hands (from below upwards) must be used when shooting a goal and must be attempted within five (5) seconds from the time the ball is received.  When a penalty goal has been awarded, any of the three opposing goal shooters can attempt a goal from any position outside the goal circle.  A penalty goal must be attempted within three (3) seconds.  A goal shooter can also attempt a penalty from behind the penalty line within three (3) seconds.

Players may try to gain possession of the ball without hitting or snatching the ball from the opponent's hands.  Players are not allowed to hold, push away or obstruct their opponents in any manner to prevent them from passing the ball.  Two (2) players of the same team may not touch or hold the ball simultaneously.  It is an infringement if the ball crosses the section without being touched by a player in that section.

When players of both teams commit a transgression simultaneously, it is called a double fault.  The referee then tosses the ball into the air between two opposing players where the transgressions occurred.  The two opposing players then attempt to gain possession of the ball by hitting or catching the ball on the descend.

A match consists of two-halves of 25 minutes each with an interval of three (3) minutes.  After each successful goal, the players must take up position as shown on the image.  The centre player stands in the half circle facing his own goalpost.  At the blow of the whistle the ball must be passed to one of the wings within two (2) seconds.  It is an infringement when the ball is passed to another section without passing to a wing first.

When the ball goes out of play crossing the outside lines, an opposing player from that section puts the ball into play on the spot where it has left the court.

The team with the highest score at the end of the match is the winning team.

== Rules ==

===The Court===

1.	The court<ref>Ringball South Africa – Rules of the game, updated April 2016.  Approved AGM 2015</ref> is 27 m x 18 m in size and is divided into three (3) equal sections (9 m x 18 m).  The two goalposts are situated in the middle of each short side of the court against the outside line.  Each goalpost has a steel ring of 450mm in diameter attached at the top, exactly 3 m from the ground.  With the goalpost as pivot a half circle (the goal circle) with a radius of 4,5 m is drawn.  The penalty line is short line in the goal section 1 m in length and 2 m from the middle inside line directly in line with the middle half circles. The two side sections are called the goal sections and the middle section is called the centre section.  Exactly in the middle of the centre section, a circle of 1 m diameter and in the middle of the two inside lines, two half circles with a diameter of 1 m are drawn.  On either side of the centre circle two "V”-lines with legs of 1 m long are drawn and this is referred to as the "V”. See the diagram below for the position of the goalposts.
