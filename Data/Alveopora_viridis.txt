'''''Alveopora viridis''''' is a species of [[Scleractinia|stony coral]] that has a highly [[Disjunct distribution|disjunct]] range, and can be found in the [[Red Sea]], the [[Gulf of Aden]], the northern Indian Ocean and in [[Palau]] and the [[Mariana Islands]]. It is found on lower [[coral reef]] slopes to depths of 50&nbsp;m. It is particularly susceptible to [[coral bleaching]] and is harvested for the aquarium trade.

==Description==
[[Colony (biology)|Colonies]] of ''Alveopora viridis'' are submassive or columnar. The  [[corallite]]s are very small and the [[Septum (coral)|septa]] bear spines of two different lengths. The colonies are usually some shade of greyish-brown or greenish-brown.<ref name=AIMS>{{cite web |url=http://coral.aims.gov.au/factsheet.jsp?speciesCode=0904 |title=''Alveopora viridis'' |year=2013 |publisher=Australian Institute of Marine Science |accessdate=7 August 2015}}</ref>

==Biology==
''Alveopora viridis'' is a [[Zooxanthellae|zooxanthellate]] species of coral.<ref name=WoRMS/> It obtains most of its nutritional needs from the [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]] [[dinoflagellate]]s that live inside its soft tissues. These [[Photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] organisms provide the coral with organic carbon and nitrogen, sometimes providing up to 90% of their host's energy needs for metabolism and growth. The remaining needs of the colony are met from the assimilation of [[plankton]]ic organisms caught by the tentacles of the polyps.<ref name=Ruppert>{{cite book |title=Invertebrate Zoology |edition=7th |last1=Ruppert |first1=Edward E. |last2=Fox |first2=Richard, S. |last3=Barnes |first3=Robert D. |year=2004 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=978-81-315-0104-7 |page=122 }}</ref>

==Status==
This coral is particularly susceptible to [[coral bleaching]] and it is harvested for the [[reef aquarium]] trade.  All corals receive protection by being listed on [[CITES Appendix II]]. The main threats faced by corals are related to [[climate change]]; the mechanical destruction of their coral reef habitats, increasing damage from extreme weather events, rising sea water temperatures and [[ocean acidification]]. ''Alveopora viridis'' has a wide range but has a number of separate subpopulations and is generally uncommon. The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] has assessed its conservation status as being "[[Near-threatened species|near-threatened]]".<ref name=iucn/>
