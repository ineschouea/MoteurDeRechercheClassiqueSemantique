'''Olrog's gull''' (''Larus atlanticus'') is a species of [[gull]] found along the [[Atlantic]] coast of southern [[Brazil]], [[Uruguay]] and northern [[Argentina]]. It was formerly considered a [[subspecies]] of the very similar ''[[Belcher's gull|L. belcheri]]''. It is a large gull with a black back and wings, white head and underparts, a black band in the otherwise white tail, and a yellow bill with a red and black tip. Non-breeding adults have a blackish head and a white eye-ring. The species is named after Swedish-Argentine biologist Claes C. Olrog.<ref name = "Auk">{{Cite journal

==Distribution==
[[File:Olrog's Gull.jpg|thumb|left|South Brazil]]
Olrog’s Gull is native to the Atlantic coast of Argentina, Uruguay and southern Brazil. It breeds at a very limited number of colonies between 38.49° and 45.11°S, about two thirds of which are in the estuary of the [[Bahía Blanca|Bahia Blanca River]]. It nests on the ground just above high-water mark, on low islands and islets. At other times it is to be seen on rocky coasts, harbours, beaches, coastal lagoons, brackish water and estuaries.<ref name=BLI>{{cite web |url=http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3210 |title=Species factsheet: ''Larus atlanticus'' |publisher=BirdLife International |accessdate=2013-12-13}}</ref>

==Behavior==
During the breeding season, Olrog’s gull feeds largely on [[crab]]s which are picked up from the exposed shore or the seabed while walking or swimming, or dipping under the surface of shallow water. This particular diet gives the gull its name in its native range: ''gaviota cangrejera'', or crabeater gull.

At other times of year it supplements its crab diet with [[Bivalvia|bivalve molluscs]] and [[Polychaeta|polychaete worms]]. Other prey items include insects, [[Gastropoda|gastropod molluscs]], fish and fish waste and the birds sometimes visit sewage outlets and refuse dumps.<ref name=Lifehistory>{{cite web |url=http://neotropical.birds.cornell.edu/portal/species/lifehistory?p_p_spp=22670 |title=''Larus atlanticus'' |work=NeoTropical Birds |publisher=The Cornell Lab of Ornithology |accessdate=2013-12-13}}</ref>

Breeding starts in September and October. Olrog’s gull is [[Monogamy|monogamous]] and nests in dense colonies. The nest is on rock, sand or shingle and is usually lined with vegetation but sometimes with seaweed, feathers, shells or bones. Two or three olive-brown eggs with brown splotches are laid and the [[Egg incubation|incubation]] period is about thirty days. Fledging takes place between November and January according to the location of the colony.<ref name=Lifehistory/>
