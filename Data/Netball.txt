'''Netball''' is a [[ball sport]] played by two teams of seven players. Its development, derived from early versions of [[basketball]], began in England in the 1890s. By 1960, international playing rules had been standardised for the game, and the International Federation of Netball and Women's Basketball (later renamed the [[International Netball Federation]] (INF)) was formed. As of 2011, the INF comprises more than 60 [[List of national netball teams|national teams]] organized into five global regions.

Games are played on a rectangular [[Rules of netball#Court and dimensions|court]] with raised goal rings at each end. Each team attempts to score goals by passing a ball down the court and shooting it through its goal ring. Players are assigned specific positions, which define their roles within the team and restrict their movement to certain areas of the court. During general play, a player with the ball can hold on to it for only three seconds before shooting for a goal or passing to another player. The winning team is the one that scores the most goals. Netball games are 60 minutes long. Variations have been developed to increase the game's pace and appeal to a wider audience.

Netball is most popular in [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth nations]], specifically in schools, and is predominantly played by women. According to the INF, netball is played by more than 20 million people in more than 80 countries.<ref name="INF-History"/><ref name=Thompson-258/> Major domestic leagues in the sport include the [[Netball Superleague]] in Great Britain, [[Suncorp Super Netball]] in Australia and the [[ANZ Premiership]] in New Zealand. Four major competitions take place internationally: the [[wikt:quadrennial|quadrennial]] [[World Netball Championships]], the [[Netball at the Commonwealth Games|Commonwealth Games]], and the yearly [[Netball Quad Series|Quad Series]] and [[World Netball Series|Fast5 Series]]. In 1995, netball became an [[Netball and the Olympic Movement|International Olympic Committee recognised sport]], but it has not been played at the Olympics.

==History==
{{Main|History of netball}}

Netball emerged from early versions of [[basketball]] and evolved into its own sport as the number of women participating in sports increased. Basketball was invented in 1891 by [[James Naismith]] in the United States. The game was initially played indoors between two teams of nine players, using an [[association football (ball)|association football]] that was thrown into closed-end peach baskets.<ref name=GrundyShackelford>{{harvnb|Grundy|Shackelford|2007|p=13}}</ref> Naismith's game spread quickly across the United States and variations of the rules soon emerged. [[Physical education]] instructor [[Senda Berenson]] developed modified rules for women in 1892; these eventually gave rise to [[women's basketball]]. Around this time separate intercollegiate rules were developed for men and women.<ref name=JoblingBarham-30>{{cite journal |last1=Jobling |first1=Ian |last2=Barham |first2=Pamela |title=The Development of Netball and the All-Australia Women's Basketball Association (AAWBBA): 1891–1939 |journal=Sporting Traditions, Journal of the Australian Society for Sports History |volume=8 |issue=1 |date=November 1991|pages=30–48 |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/SportingTraditions/1991/st0801/st0801e.pdf |ref=harv}}</ref> The various basketball rules converged into a universal set in the United States.

[[Martina Bergman-Österberg]] introduced a version of basketball in 1893 to her female students at the Physical Training College in [[Hampstead]], London.<ref name=McIntosh-292>{{harvnb|McIntosh|1968|p=292}}</ref> The rules of the game were modified at the college over several years: the game moved outdoors and was played on grass; the baskets were replaced by rings that had nets; and in 1897 and 1899, rules from women's basketball in the United States were incorporated.<ref name=JoblingBarham-30/><ref name=aena-13>{{harvnb|All England Netball Association|1976|p=13}}</ref> Österberg's new sport acquired the name "net ball".<ref name=EnglandNetball-History>{{cite web |author=England Netball |title=History of England Netball (1891–2008) |url=http://www.englandnetball.co.uk/about-england-netball/history_of_england_netball |accessdate=4 March 2011 |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719151135/https://www.englandnetball.co.uk/about-england-netball/history_of_england_netball |archivedate=19 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The first codified rules of netball were published in 1901 by the Ling Association, later the [[Physical Education Association of the United Kingdom]].<ref name="Taylor-2001">{{cite journal |last=Taylor |first=Tracy |title=Gendering Sport: The Development of Netball in Australia |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/SportingTraditions/2001/st1801/ST1801i.pdf |journal=Sporting Traditions, Journal of the Australian Society for Sports History |volume=18 |issue=1 |date=November 2001|pages=57–74 |ref=harv}}</ref><ref name=TheSportsBook165>{{harvnb|Summers|2007|p=165}}</ref> From England, netball spread to other countries in the [[British Empire]].

In Australia, the term ''women's basketball'' was used to refer to both netball and basketball.<ref name=Jack-Pollard>{{harvnb|Pollard|1968|p=59}}</ref> During the 1950s and 1960s, a movement arose to change the Australian name of the game from ''women's basketball'' to ''netball'' in order to avoid confusion between the two sports. The [[Basketball Australia|Australian Basketball Union]] offered to pay the costs involved to alter the name, but the netball organisation rejected the change.<ref name="Jack-Pollard"/> In 1970, the Council of the All Australia Netball Association officially changed the name to "netball" in Australia.<ref name="Taylor-2001"/>

In 1963, the first international tournament was held in [[Eastbourne]], England.

At the beginning of every quarter and after a goal has been scored, play starts with a player in the centre position passing the ball from the centre of the court. These "centre passes" alternate between the teams, regardless of which team scored the last goal. When the umpire blows the whistle to restart play, four players from each team can move into the centre third to receive the pass. The centre pass must be caught or touched in the centre third.<ref name=Shakespear-xiii>{{harvnb|Shakespear|Caldow|2009|p=xiii}}</ref><ref name=Slade-2009>{{harvnb|Slade|2009|p=98}}</ref> The ball is then moved up and down the court through passing and must be touched by a player in each adjacent third of the court. Players can hold the ball for only three seconds at any time. It must be released before the foot they were standing on when they caught it touches the ground again.<ref name=Netball-book /> Contact between players is only permitted if it does not impede an opponent or the general play. When defending a pass or shot players must be at least {{convert|90|cm}} away from the player with the ball. If illegal contact is made, the player who contacted cannot participate in play until the player taking the penalty has passed or shot the ball.<ref name=Hickey-31>{{harvnb|Hickey|Navin|2007|p=31}}</ref> If the ball is held in two hands and either dropped or a shot at goal is missed, the same player cannot be the first to touch it unless it first rebounds off the goal.<ref name=Shakespear-15>{{harvnb|Shakespear|Caldow|2009|pp=15–19}}</ref>

Indoor netball is a variation of netball, played exclusively indoors, in which the playing court is often surrounded on each side and overhead by a net.

Different forms of indoor netball exist. In a seven-per-side version called "action netball", seven players per team play with rules similar to netball. However, a game is split into 15-minute halves with a three-minute break in between. This version is played in Australia,<ref name=INA>{{cite web |title=Indoor Netball Australia Rule Book |author=Indoor Netball Australia |year=2003 |url=http://www.indoornetball.org.au/images/stories/rules/INARULEBOOK_V2010.PDF |accessdate=7 March 2011 |ref=harv}}</ref> New Zealand,<ref name=NZISa>{{cite web |author=New Zealand Indoor Netball |title=7-a-side Indoor Netball Official Rule Book |url=http://www.nzindoorsports.org.nz/fileadmin/templates/rules/7aside_NZIS_Indoor_Netball_Rules_2008.pdf |date=January 2008 |accessdate=7 March 2011 |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724200641/https://www.nzindoorsports.org.nz/fileadmin/templates/rules/7aside_NZIS_Indoor_Netball_Rules_2008.pdf |archivedate=24 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> South Africa<ref name=alswang-2003>{{harvnb|Alswang|2003}}</ref> and England.<ref name=AN-England>{{cite web |author=Action Indoor Sports (England) |title=Action Netball: 7 A-Side |url=http://www.actionsportuk.com/action-netball |accessdate=7 March 2011 |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707081058/https://www.actionsportuk.com/action-netball |archivedate=7 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

A six-per-side version of the sport is also played in New Zealand. Two Centres per team can play in the whole court except the shooting circles; the remaining attacking and defending players are each restricted to one half of the court, including the shooting circles. The attacking and Centre players may shoot from outside the shooting circle for a two-point goal.<ref name=NZIS>{{cite web |author=New Zealand Indoor Netball |title=Indoor Netball Official Rule Book (6-a-side) |url=http://www.nzindoorsports.org.nz/fileadmin/templates/rules/6_aside_NZIS_Indoor_Netball_Rules_Oct_2009.pdf |date=October 2009 |accessdate=7 March 2011 |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724200646/https://www.nzindoorsports.org.nz/fileadmin/templates/rules/6_aside_NZIS_Indoor_Netball_Rules_Oct_2009.pdf |archivedate=24 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=Planet-Sport>{{cite web |url=http://www.planetsports.co.nz/wa.asp?idWebPage=36815&idDetails=165 |author=Planet Sport |title=Indoor Netball at Planet Sports |accessdate=3 March 2011 |ref=harv| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110724194100/http://www.planetsports.co.nz/wa.asp?idWebPage=36815&idDetails=165| archivedate =24 July 2011}}</ref>

A five-per-side game is also common in indoor netball. Players can move throughout the court, with the exception of the shooting circles, which are restricted to certain attacking or defending players.

===For children===
[[File:Reygersdal netball.jpg|thumb|upright|Children playing [[netball in South Africa]]]]
Netball has been adapted in several ways to meet children's needs. The rules for children are similar to those for adults, but various aspects of the game (such as the length of each quarter, goal height, and ball size) are modified.

Fun Net is a version of netball developed by [[Netball Australia]] for five- to seven-year-olds. It aims to improve basic netball skills using games and activities.<ref name=Netball-Injury-50>{{harvnb|McGrath|Ozanne-Smith|1998|p=50}}</ref> The Fun Net program runs for 8–16 weeks. There are no winners or losers. The goal posts are {{convert|2.4|m}} high, and a smaller ball is used.<ref name=nsw-fun>{{cite web |author=NSW Department of Sport & Recreation |title=Netball |year=1997 |url=http://www.cybersydney.com.au/kids/sar/netball.html |accessdate=3 March 2011 |ref=harv}}</ref>

Netball Australia also runs a modified game called Netta aimed at 8- to 11-year-olds.<ref name=Netball-Injury-51>{{harvnb|McGrath|Ozanne-Smith|1998|p=51}}</ref> The goal height and ball size are the same as for adults, but players rotate positions during the game, permitting each player to play each position.<ref name=Plaisted>{{cite web |last=Plaisted |first=Val |title=A comparison of the effectiveness of the modified with the traditional approach to junior netball |url=http://eprints.vu.edu.au/15665/1/Plaisted_1989compressed.pdf |year=1989 |publisher=Victoria University |accessdate=4 March 2011 |ref=harv}}</ref> Netta was created to develop passing and catching skills. Its rules permit six seconds between catching and passing the ball, instead of the three seconds permitted in the adult game.<ref name=Netball-Injury-51/> Most players under 11 play this version at netball clubs.<ref name=Plaisted/>

There are four major international netball competitions; the [[Netball World Cup]], [[Netball at the Commonwealth Games]], [[Netball Quad Series]] and [[Fast5 Netball World Series]].

Netball's important competition is the [[World Netball Championships]] (also known as the Netball World Cup), held every four years.  It was first held in 1963 at the [[University of Brighton|Chelsea College of Physical Education]] at [[Eastbourne]], England, with eleven nations competing.  Since its inception the competition has been dominated primarily by the Australian and New Zealand teams, which hold ten and four titles, respectively.

'''Netball''' is a [[ball sport]] played by two teams of seven players. Its development, derived from early versions of [[basketball]], began in England in the 1890s. By 1960, international playing rules had been standardised for the game, and the International Federation of Netball and Women's Basketball (later renamed the [[International Netball Federation]] (INF)) was formed. As of 2011, the INF comprises more than 60 [[List of national netball teams|national teams]] organized into five global regions.

Games are played on a rectangular [[Rules of netball#Court and dimensions|court]] with raised goal rings at each end. Each team attempts to score goals by passing a ball down the court and shooting it through its goal ring. Players are assigned specific positions, which define their roles within the team and restrict their movement to certain areas of the court. During general play, a player with the ball can hold on to it for only three seconds before shooting for a goal or passing to another player. The winning team is the one that scores the most goals. Netball games are 60 minutes long. Variations have been developed to increase the game's pace and appeal to a wider audience.

Netball is most popular in [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth nations]], specifically in schools, and is predominantly played by women. According to the INF, netball is played by more than 20 million people in more than 80 countries.<ref name="INF-History"/><ref name=Thompson-258/> Major domestic leagues in the sport include the [[Netball Superleague]] in Great Britain, [[Suncorp Super Netball]] in Australia and the [[ANZ Premiership]] in New Zealand. Four major competitions take place internationally: the [[wikt:quadrennial|quadrennial]] [[World Netball Championships]], the [[Netball at the Commonwealth Games|Commonwealth Games]], and the yearly [[Netball Quad Series|Quad Series]] and [[World Netball Series|Fast5 Series]]. In 1995, netball became an [[Netball and the Olympic Movement|International Olympic Committee recognised sport]], but it has not been played at the Olympics.

==History==
{{Main|History of netball}}

Netball emerged from early versions of [[basketball]] and evolved into its own sport as the number of women participating in sports increased. Basketball was invented in 1891 by [[James Naismith]] in the United States. The game was initially played indoors between two teams of nine players, using an [[association football (ball)|association football]] that was thrown into closed-end peach baskets.<ref name=GrundyShackelford>{{harvnb|Grundy|Shackelford|2007|p=13}}</ref> Naismith's game spread quickly across the United States and variations of the rules soon emerged. [[Physical education]] instructor [[Senda Berenson]] developed modified rules for women in 1892; these eventually gave rise to [[women's basketball]]. Around this time separate intercollegiate rules were developed for men and women.<ref name=JoblingBarham-30>{{cite journal |last1=Jobling |first1=Ian |last2=Barham |first2=Pamela |title=The Development of Netball and the All-Australia Women's Basketball Association (AAWBBA): 1891–1939 |journal=Sporting Traditions, Journal of the Australian Society for Sports History |volume=8 |issue=1 |date=November 1991|pages=30–48 |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/SportingTraditions/1991/st0801/st0801e.pdf |ref=harv}}</ref> The various basketball rules converged into a universal set in the United States.

In Australia, the term ''women's basketball'' was used to refer to both netball and basketball.<ref name=Jack-Pollard>{{harvnb|Pollard|1968|p=59}}</ref> During the 1950s and 1960s, a movement arose to change the Australian name of the game from ''women's basketball'' to ''netball'' in order to avoid confusion between the two sports. The [[Basketball Australia|Australian Basketball Union]] offered to pay the costs involved to alter the name, but the netball organisation rejected the change.<ref name="Jack-Pollard"/> In 1970, the Council of the All Australia Netball Association officially changed the name to "netball" in Australia.<ref name="Taylor-2001"/>

In 1963, the first international tournament was held in [[Eastbourne]], England. Originally called the World Tournament, it later became known as the [[World Netball Championships]].<ref name=aena-19>{{harvnb|All England Netball Association|1976|p=19}}</ref> Following the first tournament, one of the organisers, Miss R.

At the beginning of every quarter and after a goal has been scored, play starts with a player in the centre position passing the ball from the centre of the court. These "centre passes" alternate between the teams, regardless of which team scored the last goal. When the umpire blows the whistle to restart play, four players from each team can move into the centre third to receive the pass. The centre pass must be caught or touched in the centre third.<ref name=Shakespear-xiii>{{harvnb|Shakespear|Caldow|2009|p=xiii}}</ref><ref name=Slade-2009>{{harvnb|Slade|2009|p=98}}</ref> The ball is then moved up and down the court through passing and must be touched by a player in each adjacent third of the court. Players can hold the ball for only three seconds at any time.

When defending a pass or shot players must be at least {{convert|90|cm}} away from the player with the ball. If illegal contact is made, the player who contacted cannot participate in play until the player taking the penalty has passed or shot the ball.<ref name=Hickey-31>{{harvnb|Hickey|Navin|2007|p=31}}</ref> If the ball is held in two hands and either dropped or a shot at goal is missed, the same player cannot be the first to touch it unless it first rebounds off the goal.<ref name=Shakespear-15>{{harvnb|Shakespear|Caldow|2009|pp=15–19}}</ref>

[[File:Indoor Netball Finals 2014 - Last Quarter.webm|thumb|Indoor Netball, 2014]]
Indoor netball is a variation of netball, played exclusively indoors, in which the playing court is often surrounded on each side and overhead by a net. The net prevents the ball from leaving the court, permitting faster play by reducing playing stoppages.<ref name=Alswang-2>{{harvnb|Alswang|2003|p=2}}</ref>

Different forms of indoor netball exist. In a seven-per-side version called "action netball", seven players per team play with rules similar to netball. However, a game is split into 15-minute halves with a three-minute break in between. This version is played in Australia,<ref name=INA>{{cite web |title=Indoor Netball Australia Rule Book |author=Indoor Netball Australia |year=2003 |url=http://www.indoornetball.org.au/images/stories/rules/INARULEBOOK_V2010.PDF |accessdate=7 March 2011 |ref=harv}}</ref> New Zealand,<ref name=NZISa>{{cite web |author=New Zealand Indoor Netball |title=7-a-side Indoor Netball Official Rule Book |url=http://www.nzindoorsports.org.nz/fileadmin/templates/rules/7aside_NZIS_Indoor_Netball_Rules_2008.pdf |date=January 2008 |accessdate=7 March 2011 |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724200641/https://www.nzindoorsports.org.nz/fileadmin/templates/rules/7aside_NZIS_Indoor_Netball_Rules_2008.pdf |archivedate=24 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> South Africa<ref name=alswang-2003>{{harvnb|Alswang|2003}}</ref> and England.<ref name=AN-England>{{cite web |author=Action Indoor Sports (England) |title=Action Netball: 7 A-Side |url=http://www.actionsportuk.com/action-netball |accessdate=7 March 2011 |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707081058/https://www.actionsportuk.com/action-netball |archivedate=7 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

A six-per-side version of the sport is also played in New Zealand.

Netball has been adapted in several ways to meet children's needs. The rules for children are similar to those for adults, but various aspects of the game (such as the length of each quarter, goal height, and ball size) are modified.

Fun Net is a version of netball developed by [[Netball Australia]] for five- to seven-year-olds. It aims to improve basic netball skills using games and activities.<ref name=Netball-Injury-50>{{harvnb|McGrath|Ozanne-Smith|1998|p=50}}</ref> The Fun Net program runs for 8–16 weeks. There are no winners or losers. The goal posts are {{convert|2.4|m}} high, and a smaller ball is used.<ref name=nsw-fun>{{cite web |author=NSW Department of Sport & Recreation |title=Netball |year=1997 |url=http://www.cybersydney.com.au/kids/sar/netball.html |accessdate=3 March 2011 |ref=harv}}</ref>

Netball Australia also runs a modified game called Netta aimed at 8- to 11-year-olds.<ref name=Netball-Injury-51>{{harvnb|McGrath|Ozanne-Smith|1998|p=51}}</ref> The goal height and ball size are the same as for adults, but players rotate positions during the game, permitting each player to play each position.<ref name=Plaisted>{{cite web |last=Plaisted |first=Val |title=A comparison of the effectiveness of the modified with the traditional approach to junior netball |url=http://eprints.vu.edu.au/15665/1/Plaisted_1989compressed.pdf |year=1989 |publisher=Victoria University |accessdate=4 March 2011 |ref=harv}}</ref> Netta was created to develop passing and catching skills. Its rules permit six seconds between catching and passing the ball, instead of the three seconds permitted in the adult game.<ref name=Netball-Injury-51/> Most players under 11 play this version at netball clubs.<ref name=Plaisted/>

A version called High Five Netball is promoted by the [[All England Netball Association]].<ref name=BBCSA /> It is aimed at 9- to 11-year-old girls and includes only five positions.<ref name=BBCSA>{{Cite news |author=BBC Sport Academy |title=Get playing high five netball! |publisher=BBC Sport Academy |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sportacademy/hi/sa/netball/give_it_a_go/newsid_2933000/2933617.stm |accessdate=27 February 2011 |ref=harv |date=11 April 2003}}</ref> The players swap positions during the game.<ref name=egh5n-2010>{{cite web |author=East Grinstead High Fives Netball |url=http://www.egjnl.org.uk/High_Five.html |title=Hi-5 Information |date=17 November 2010 |accessdate=4 March 2011 |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110307110439/https://www.egjnl.org.uk/High_Five.html |archivedate=7 March 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> When a player is not on the court, she is expected to help the game in some other way, such as being the timekeeper or scorekeeper.<ref name=BBCSA /> High Five Netball has four six-minute quarters.<ref name=BBCSA /><ref name=egh5n-2010/>

==Governance==
The recognised international governing body of netball is the [[International Federation of Netball Associations]] (IFNA), based in [[Manchester]], England.<ref name=TheSportsBook165/> Founded in 1960, the organisation was initially called the International Federation of Netball and Women's Basketball.<ref name=INF-History/> The IFNA is responsible for compiling [[IFNA World Rankings|world rankings]] for national teams, maintaining the rules for netball and organising several major international competitions.

There are four major international netball competitions; the [[Netball World Cup]], [[Netball at the Commonwealth Games]], [[Netball Quad Series]] and [[Fast5 Netball World Series]].

Netball's important competition is the [[World Netball Championships]] (also known as the Netball World Cup), held every four years.  It was first held in 1963 at the [[University of Brighton|Chelsea College of Physical Education]] at [[Eastbourne]], England, with eleven nations competing.  Since its inception the competition has been dominated primarily by the Australian and New Zealand teams, which hold ten and four titles, respectively. Trinidad and Tobago is the only other team to win a championship title. That title, won in 1979, was shared with New Zealand and Australia; all three teams finished with equal points at the end of the round robin, and there were no finals.<ref name=NWC-singapore>{{cite web|author=World Netball Championships 2011 Singapore |title=History |url=http://www.wnc2011.com/home/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=160&Itemid=213 |year=2011 |accessdate=3 March 2011 |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314064619/http://www.wnc2011.com/home/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=160&Itemid=213 |archivedate=14 March 2011 }}</ref>

'''Netball''' is a [[ball sport]] played by two teams of seven players. Its development, derived from early versions of [[basketball]], began in England in the 1890s. By 1960, international playing rules had been standardised for the game, and the International Federation of Netball and Women's Basketball (later renamed the [[International Netball Federation]] (INF)) was formed. As of 2011, the INF comprises more than 60 [[List of national netball teams|national teams]] organized into five global regions.

Games are played on a rectangular [[Rules of netball#Court and dimensions|court]] with raised goal rings at each end. Each team attempts to score goals by passing a ball down the court and shooting it through its goal ring. Players are assigned specific positions, which define their roles within the team and restrict their movement to certain areas of the court. During general play, a player with the ball can hold on to it for only three seconds before shooting for a goal or passing to another player. The winning team is the one that scores the most goals. Netball games are 60 minutes long. Variations have been developed to increase the game's pace and appeal to a wider audience.

Netball is most popular in [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth nations]], specifically in schools, and is predominantly played by women. According to the INF, netball is played by more than 20 million people in more than 80 countries.<ref name="INF-History"/><ref name=Thompson-258/> Major domestic leagues in the sport include the [[Netball Superleague]] in Great Britain, [[Suncorp Super Netball]] in Australia and the [[ANZ Premiership]] in New Zealand. Four major competitions take place internationally: the [[wikt:quadrennial|quadrennial]] [[World Netball Championships]], the [[Netball at the Commonwealth Games|Commonwealth Games]], and the yearly [[Netball Quad Series|Quad Series]] and [[World Netball Series|Fast5 Series]]. In 1995, netball became an [[Netball and the Olympic Movement|International Olympic Committee recognised sport]], but it has not been played at the Olympics.

==History==
{{Main|History of netball}}

Netball emerged from early versions of [[basketball]] and evolved into its own sport as the number of women participating in sports increased. Basketball was invented in 1891 by [[James Naismith]] in the United States. The game was initially played indoors between two teams of nine players, using an [[association football (ball)|association football]] that was thrown into closed-end peach baskets.<ref name=GrundyShackelford>{{harvnb|Grundy|Shackelford|2007|p=13}}</ref> Naismith's game spread quickly across the United States and variations of the rules soon emerged. [[Physical education]] instructor [[Senda Berenson]] developed modified rules for women in 1892; these eventually gave rise to [[women's basketball]]. Around this time separate intercollegiate rules were developed for men and women.<ref name=JoblingBarham-30>{{cite journal |last1=Jobling |first1=Ian |last2=Barham |first2=Pamela |title=The Development of Netball and the All-Australia Women's Basketball Association (AAWBBA): 1891–1939 |journal=Sporting Traditions, Journal of the Australian Society for Sports History |volume=8 |issue=1 |date=November 1991|pages=30–48 |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/SportingTraditions/1991/st0801/st0801e.pdf |ref=harv}}</ref> The various basketball rules converged into a universal set in the United States.

[[Martina Bergman-Österberg]] introduced a version of basketball in 1893 to her female students at the Physical Training College in [[Hampstead]], London.<ref name=McIntosh-292>{{harvnb|McIntosh|1968|p=292}}</ref> The rules of the game were modified at the college over several years: the game moved outdoors and was played on grass; the baskets were replaced by rings that had nets; and in 1897 and 1899, rules from women's basketball in the United States were incorporated.<ref name=JoblingBarham-30/><ref name=aena-13>{{harvnb|All England Netball Association|1976|p=13}}</ref> Österberg's new sport acquired the name "net ball".<ref name=EnglandNetball-History>{{cite web |author=England Netball |title=History of England Netball (1891–2008) |url=http://www.englandnetball.co.uk/about-england-netball/history_of_england_netball |accessdate=4 March 2011 |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719151135/https://www.englandnetball.co.uk/about-england-netball/history_of_england_netball |archivedate=19 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The first codified rules of netball were published in 1901 by the Ling Association, later the [[Physical Education Association of the United Kingdom]].<ref name="Taylor-2001">{{cite journal |last=Taylor |first=Tracy |title=Gendering Sport: The Development of Netball in Australia |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/SportingTraditions/2001/st1801/ST1801i.pdf |journal=Sporting Traditions, Journal of the Australian Society for Sports History |volume=18 |issue=1 |date=November 2001|pages=57–74 |ref=harv}}</ref><ref name=TheSportsBook165>{{harvnb|Summers|2007|p=165}}</ref> From England, netball spread to other countries in the [[British Empire]].

In Australia, the term ''women's basketball'' was used to refer to both netball and basketball.<ref name=Jack-Pollard>{{harvnb|Pollard|1968|p=59}}</ref> During the 1950s and 1960s, a movement arose to change the Australian name of the game from ''women's basketball'' to ''netball'' in order to avoid confusion between the two sports. The [[Basketball Australia|Australian Basketball Union]] offered to pay the costs involved to alter the name, but the netball organisation rejected the change.<ref name="Jack-Pollard"/> In 1970, the Council of the All Australia Netball Association officially changed the name to "netball" in Australia.<ref name="Taylor-2001"/>

In 1963, the first international tournament was held in [[Eastbourne]], England. Originally called the World Tournament, it later became known as the [[World Netball Championships]].<ref name=aena-19>{{harvnb|All England Netball Association|1976|p=19}}</ref> Following the first tournament, one of the organisers, Miss R.

The World Netball Championships have been held every four years since, most recently in 2015. The [[World Youth Netball Championships]] started in [[Canberra]] in 1988, and have been held roughly every four years since.

The objective of a game is to score more goals than the opposition. Goals are scored when a team member positioned in the attacking shooting circle shoots the ball through the goal ring. The goal rings are {{convert|380|mm}} in diameter and sit atop {{convert|3.05|m|adj=on}}-high goal posts that have no backboards.<ref name=NA-court/> A {{convert|4.9|m|adj=on}}-radius semi-circular "shooting circle" is an area at each end of the court. The goal posts are located within the shooting circle. Each team defends one shooting circle and attacks the other.<ref name=NA-court>{{cite web |author=Netball Australia |title=Court & venue specifications |publisher=[[Netball Australia]] |url=http://www.netball.asn.au/extra.asp?id=29&OrgID=1&menu=10706 |accessdate=2 March 2011 |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110227072539/http://netball.asn.au//extra.asp?id=29&OrgID=1&menu=10706 |archivedate=27 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The netball court is {{convert|30.5|m}} long, {{convert|15.25|m}} wide, and divided lengthwise into thirds.

At the beginning of every quarter and after a goal has been scored, play starts with a player in the centre position passing the ball from the centre of the court. These "centre passes" alternate between the teams, regardless of which team scored the last goal. When the umpire blows the whistle to restart play, four players from each team can move into the centre third to receive the pass. The centre pass must be caught or touched in the centre third.<ref name=Shakespear-xiii>{{harvnb|Shakespear|Caldow|2009|p=xiii}}</ref><ref name=Slade-2009>{{harvnb|Slade|2009|p=98}}</ref> The ball is then moved up and down the court through passing and must be touched by a player in each adjacent third of the court. Players can hold the ball for only three seconds at any time. It must be released before the foot they were standing on when they caught it touches the ground again.<ref name=Netball-book /> Contact between players is only permitted if it does not impede an opponent or the general play. When defending a pass or shot players must be at least {{convert|90|cm}} away from the player with the ball. If illegal contact is made, the player who contacted cannot participate in play until the player taking the penalty has passed or shot the ball.<ref name=Hickey-31>{{harvnb|Hickey|Navin|2007|p=31}}</ref> If the ball is held in two hands and either dropped or a shot at goal is missed, the same player cannot be the first to touch it unless it first rebounds off the goal.<ref name=Shakespear-15>{{harvnb|Shakespear|Caldow|2009|pp=15–19}}</ref>

===Indoor netball===<!--Not to be confused with standard netball games played indoors.-->
{{main|Indoor netball}}
[[File:Indoor Netball Finals 2014 - Last Quarter.webm|thumb|Indoor Netball, 2014]]
Indoor netball is a variation of netball, played exclusively indoors, in which the playing court is often surrounded on each side and overhead by a net. The net prevents the ball from leaving the court, permitting faster play by reducing playing stoppages.<ref name=Alswang-2>{{harvnb|Alswang|2003|p=2}}</ref>

Different forms of indoor netball exist. In a seven-per-side version called "action netball", seven players per team play with rules similar to netball. However, a game is split into 15-minute halves with a three-minute break in between. This version is played in Australia,<ref name=INA>{{cite web |title=Indoor Netball Australia Rule Book |author=Indoor Netball Australia |year=2003 |url=http://www.indoornetball.org.au/images/stories/rules/INARULEBOOK_V2010.PDF |accessdate=7 March 2011 |ref=harv}}</ref> New Zealand,<ref name=NZISa>{{cite web |author=New Zealand Indoor Netball |title=7-a-side Indoor Netball Official Rule Book |url=http://www.nzindoorsports.org.nz/fileadmin/templates/rules/7aside_NZIS_Indoor_Netball_Rules_2008.pdf |date=January 2008 |accessdate=7 March 2011 |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724200641/https://www.nzindoorsports.org.nz/fileadmin/templates/rules/7aside_NZIS_Indoor_Netball_Rules_2008.pdf |archivedate=24 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> South Africa<ref name=alswang-2003>{{harvnb|Alswang|2003}}</ref> and England.<ref name=AN-England>{{cite web |author=Action Indoor Sports (England) |title=Action Netball: 7 A-Side |url=http://www.actionsportuk.com/action-netball |accessdate=7 March 2011 |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707081058/https://www.actionsportuk.com/action-netball |archivedate=7 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

A six-per-side version of the sport is also played in New Zealand. Two Centres per team can play in the whole court except the shooting circles; the remaining attacking and defending players are each restricted to one half of the court, including the shooting circles. The attacking and Centre players may shoot from outside the shooting circle for a two-point goal.<ref name=NZIS>{{cite web |author=New Zealand Indoor Netball |title=Indoor Netball Official Rule Book (6-a-side) |url=http://www.nzindoorsports.org.nz/fileadmin/templates/rules/6_aside_NZIS_Indoor_Netball_Rules_Oct_2009.pdf |date=October 2009 |accessdate=7 March 2011 |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724200646/https://www.nzindoorsports.org.nz/fileadmin/templates/rules/6_aside_NZIS_Indoor_Netball_Rules_Oct_2009.pdf |archivedate=24 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=Planet-Sport>{{cite web |url=http://www.planetsports.co.nz/wa.asp?idWebPage=36815&idDetails=165 |author=Planet Sport |title=Indoor Netball at Planet Sports |accessdate=3 March 2011 |ref=harv| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110724194100/http://www.planetsports.co.nz/wa.asp?idWebPage=36815&idDetails=165| archivedate =24 July 2011}}</ref>

A five-per-side game is also common in indoor netball. Players can move throughout the court, with the exception of the shooting circles, which are restricted to certain attacking or defending players.

===For children===
[[File:Reygersdal netball.jpg|thumb|upright|Children playing [[netball in South Africa]]]]
Netball has been adapted in several ways to meet children's needs. The rules for children are similar to those for adults, but various aspects of the game (such as the length of each quarter, goal height, and ball size) are modified.

Fun Net is a version of netball developed by [[Netball Australia]] for five- to seven-year-olds. It aims to improve basic netball skills using games and activities.<ref name=Netball-Injury-50>{{harvnb|McGrath|Ozanne-Smith|1998|p=50}}</ref> The Fun Net program runs for 8–16 weeks. There are no winners or losers.

Netball Australia also runs a modified game called Netta aimed at 8- to 11-year-olds.<ref name=Netball-Injury-51>{{harvnb|McGrath|Ozanne-Smith|1998|p=51}}</ref> The goal height and ball size are the same as for adults, but players rotate positions during the game, permitting each player to play each position.<ref name=Plaisted>{{cite web |last=Plaisted |first=Val |title=A comparison of the effectiveness of the modified with the traditional approach to junior netball |url=http://eprints.vu.edu.au/15665/1/Plaisted_1989compressed.pdf |year=1989 |publisher=Victoria University |accessdate=4 March 2011 |ref=harv}}</ref> Netta was created to develop passing and catching skills. Its rules permit six seconds between catching and passing the ball, instead of the three seconds permitted in the adult game.<ref name=Netball-Injury-51/> Most players under 11 play this version at netball clubs.<ref name=Plaisted/>

There are four major international netball competitions; the [[Netball World Cup]], [[Netball at the Commonwealth Games]], [[Netball Quad Series]] and [[Fast5 Netball World Series]].

Netball's important competition is the [[World Netball Championships]] (also known as the Netball World Cup), held every four years.  It was first held in 1963 at the [[University of Brighton|Chelsea College of Physical Education]] at [[Eastbourne]], England, with eleven nations competing.  Since its inception the competition has been dominated primarily by the Australian and New Zealand teams, which hold ten and four titles, respectively. Trinidad and Tobago is the only other team to win a championship title. That title, won in 1979, was shared with New Zealand and Australia; all three teams finished with equal points at the end of the round robin, and there were no finals.<ref name=NWC-singapore>{{cite web|author=World Netball Championships 2011 Singapore |title=History |url=http://www.wnc2011.com/home/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=160&Itemid=213 |year=2011 |accessdate=3 March 2011 |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314064619/http://www.wnc2011.com/home/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=160&Itemid=213 |archivedate=14 March 2011 }}</ref>
