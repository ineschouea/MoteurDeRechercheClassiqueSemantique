Modern '''lacrosse in Canada''' has been a popular sport since the mid 1800s. Only [[field lacrosse]] was played until the 1930s, when [[box lacrosse]] was invented.

==History==
{{see also|History of lacrosse}}
Lacrosse was played by [[First Nations]] peoples before the arrival of European colonists. The first documented description of the game was in 1637. The game was called ''baggataway'' and ''tewaarathon'', which was played by two teams with 100 to 1,000 men each on a field that stretched from about {{convert|500|m|ft|abbr=on}} to {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on}} long.<ref name=CAencyclopedia>{{cite web |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/lacrosse/ |title=Lacrosse |work=The Canadian Encyclopedia |first=Barbara K. |last=Adamski}}</ref>

The Anglophone middle class of Montreal adopted the game in the mid 1800s. The first known game between whites and First Nations took place in 1843.<ref>Alan Metcalfe, "Sport and Athletics: A Case Study of Lacrosse in Canada, 1840-1889," ''Journal of Sport History,'' (1976) 3#1 pp 1-19.</ref><ref>"Highlights in the Development of Canadian Lacrosse to 1931," ''Canadian Journal of History of Sport and Physical Education,'' (1974) 5#2 pp 31-47</ref><ref>Bryan Eddington, "Little Brother of War," ''Beaver'' (2000) 80#5 pp8-14</ref>

In 1856, the Montreal lacrosse club was established; by the mid-1860s there were active teams in eastern Ontario. The National Lacrosse Association was formed in 1875; in 1880 the league became the National Amateur Lacrosse Association.<ref>Don Morrow, "The Institutionalization of Sport: A Case Study of Canadian Lacrosse, 1844-1914," ''International Journal of the History of Sport'' (1992) 9#2 pp 236-251</ref>  By the 1880s the organized sport was found nationwide, and had become a popular spectator sport.

In 1931, big city hockey promoters introduced "[[box lacrosse]]" to turn winter hockey fans into a year-round audience. Box lacrosse was played in a smaller indoor arena space, and competitions could also be held in baseball stadiums, and again, the play was violent. Not enough cities could support teams, however, and the hard times of the Great Depression in the 1930s reduced the number of fans. Entrepreneurs, while failing to make a major commercial success, transformed Canadian amateur lacrosse, making it quite different from field lacrosse as played in the United States, Britain, and Australia. In 1987 the National Lacrosse League began; it has clubs in twelve cities in the United States and Canada.<ref>Donald M.

===21st century===
In 2003, Canada participated in the inaugural World Indoor Lacrosse Championship.

The CLA along with 5 other National sporting association had their charitable status revoked in June 2010 as part of a Revenue Canada crackdown on Parklane Financial's tax shelter scheme, in which charitable organizations issued receipts far in excess of any material donations. The fact that the CLA Board of Directors agreed to participate in such a scheme may in part be due to the fact that the CLA Board of Directors is largely made up of elected lacrosse representatives, with no particular expertise in legal or financial matters of governance.

At the provincial level, the Ontario Lacrosse Association controls the majority of lacrosse in Ontario. The OLA is governed by a larger Board than the CLA, though also populated largely by members with a strong lacrosse background. OLA lacrosse officials are sanctioned by the OLA, and represented by the Ontario Lacrosse Referees Association (OLRA).  Unlike typical referee associations, the OLRA has a governing structure that is open only to Box lacrosse officials who officiate Junior/Senior/Major-series games, though the vast majority of officials do not officiate at that level. The OLRA is an extension of the OLA, and does not represent an independent officiating union.

The [[National Lacrosse League]] is a professional [[box lacrosse]] league, with franchises in Canada and the United States. The [[2006 World Lacrosse Championship]] was held in [[London, Ontario]]. Canada beat the United States 15-10 in the final to break a 28-year U.S. winning streak. One of the best lacrosse players of all time, [[Gary Gait]] was born in [[Victoria, British Columbia]] and has won every possible major lacrosse championship. Great achievements in Canadian Lacrosse are recognized by the [[Canadian Lacrosse Hall of Fame]].

Not enough cities could support teams, however, and the hard times of the Great Depression in the 1930s reduced the number of fans. Entrepreneurs, while failing to make a major commercial success, transformed Canadian amateur lacrosse, making it quite different from field lacrosse as played in the United States, Britain, and Australia. In 1987 the National Lacrosse League began; it has clubs in twelve cities in the United States and Canada.<ref>Donald M.

In 2003, Canada participated in the inaugural World Indoor Lacrosse Championship.

The CLA along with 5 other National sporting association had their charitable status revoked in June 2010 as part of a Revenue Canada crackdown on Parklane Financial's tax shelter scheme, in which charitable organizations issued receipts far in excess of any material donations. The fact that the CLA Board of Directors agreed to participate in such a scheme may in part be due to the fact that the CLA Board of Directors is largely made up of elected lacrosse representatives, with no particular expertise in legal or financial matters of governance.

At the provincial level, the Ontario Lacrosse Association controls the majority of lacrosse in Ontario. The OLA is governed by a larger Board than the CLA, though also populated largely by members with a strong lacrosse background. OLA lacrosse officials are sanctioned by the OLA, and represented by the Ontario Lacrosse Referees Association (OLRA).  Unlike typical referee associations, the OLRA has a governing structure that is open only to Box lacrosse officials who officiate Junior/Senior/Major-series games, though the vast majority of officials do not officiate at that level. The OLRA is an extension of the OLA, and does not represent an independent officiating union.

The [[National Lacrosse League]] is a professional [[box lacrosse]] league, with franchises in Canada and the United States. The [[2006 World Lacrosse Championship]] was held in [[London, Ontario]]. Canada beat the United States 15-10 in the final to break a 28-year U.S. winning streak. One of the best lacrosse players of all time, [[Gary Gait]] was born in [[Victoria, British Columbia]] and has won every possible major lacrosse championship. Great achievements in Canadian Lacrosse are recognized by the [[Canadian Lacrosse Hall of Fame]].
