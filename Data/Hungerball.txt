Hungerball is played inside an inflatable, fully enclosed arena, featuring six small goals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://promopony.com/magazine/in-trend/new-sports-2017|title=12 New Sports Trends to Try in 2017|website=Promopony|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-29}}</ref>

In line with [[FIFA|FIFA's]] age guidelines, the [[Football (ball)|footballs]] used are relative to the age of the players.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hungerball.com/|title=Hungerball {{!}} Hungerball is all-on-all soccer for fun, training and tournaments.|website=hungerball.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-29}}</ref>

The game consists of six players, all defending a goal each. One ball is used and players cannot use their hands.<ref>{{Citation|last=Hungerball Soccer|title=In all v all HUNGERBALL each player is his own team!|date=2018-01-13|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ge8yaeL46cU|access-date=2018-10-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.edgarcentre.co.nz/about-us/news/hungerball|title=News & Updates - About us {{!}} Edgar Centre - Experience Dunedin's Great Indoors|website=edgarcentre.co.nz|access-date=2018-10-29}}</ref>

== Origin ==
Hungerball was created in [[Auckland]], New Zealand. It has been said it is based on the child's game ‘all-in-all’, whereby children play a football game on the street until there is only one person left.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.localmatters.co.nz/news/7601-local-folk-andu-iordache.html|title=Local Matters - Local folk: Andu Iordache|website=localmatters.co.nz|access-date=2018-10-29}}</ref>

The name ''Hungerball'' comes from the game's aim of improving participants' hunger for possession of the ball whilst also being based upon the '''[[The Hunger Games|Hunger Games]]''' concept. Father and son founders Andu & Toma Iordache state that this can have a carryover effect into ‘individual soccer skills’.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hungerball.com/about-hungerball/|title=About HUNGERBALL {{!}} Hungerball|website=hungerball.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-29}}</ref>

== Early adoption ==

Along with this, Hungerball has also been presented in psychology talks centred around athletic development in young children and teenagers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.psychology.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/Conf-Programme-updated-16-June.pdf|website=psychology.org.nz|access-date=2019-01-10}}</ref>

== Types of games ==
There are currently two main types of Hungerball games; '''Competition''' and '''Social'''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nzaimsgames.co.nz/hungerball-world-championships/|title=Hungerball World Championships – Anchor AIMS GAMES|website=nzaimsgames.co.nz|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/thiswayup/audio/2018640498/hungerball-a-new-flavour-of-football|title=Hungerball: a new flavour of football|date=2018-04-13|work=Radio New Zealand|access-date=2018-10-29|language=en-nz}}</ref>

During '''competition games''', there are two ways to play:

# There is a fixed time period. The person who has the highest number of goals scored, minus goals conceded wins.
# It is played as an elimination challenge. Upon conceding three goals, the player is eliminated until there is only one left, who is then the winner.

During social games, players in large groups use a '''fast rotation''' system whereby whoever concedes is replaced by someone in a line waiting to get on the pitch.

There are then multiple social games to play for players which are based on '''training & development.'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thefarleygroup.com/blogs/default.cfm?ww_blogPostID=B7ED94BD-D3CF-835C-AAE3-3215A00F326E|title=4 New Soccer Derived Sports You’ve Never Heard Of|website=The Farley Group|access-date=2018-10-29}}</ref>

The rules are outlined below:

'''“ Singles – 1v1 x 6 (Hungerball meets Soccer)'''

* Dice throw decides which of the six players starts from the centre.
* Other players to remain in their goals, can come out once the ball is touched.
* One ball, no hands.
* Players can score in any of the other five goals.
* One point added for each goal scored, one point taken off for goal conceded.
* Own goal counts as goal conceded (only).
* Player who concedes a goal resumes play from the centre.
* Handball sanctioned with penalty shot to empty goal of guilty player from goal of player who last touched ball prior to hand ball.
* Similarly, fault sanctioned with penalty shot into empty goal of guilty player.
* If responsibility or benefit of fault or handball unable to be established, dice throw to decide who resumes play.

'''Team'''

* 2v2 x3 – two goals per team – similar to challenges for individuals.
* 3v3 – three goals per team, best team wins.”<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.topendsports.com/sport/new/hungerball-soccer.htm|title=The New Sport of Hungerball Soccer|website=topendsports.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-30}}</ref>

'''Field hockey adaptation'''

In its home country, Hungerball has been adapted to field hockey. It plays with the same rules as the soccer version but with the inclusion of a hockey ball and bat per player instead of a conventional football.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.topendsports.com/sport/new/hungerball-hockey.htm|title=New Sport: Hungerball Hockey|website=topendsports.com|access-date=2019-01-10}}</ref>

Father and son founders Andu & Toma Iordache state that this can have a carryover effect into ‘individual soccer skills’.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hungerball.com/about-hungerball/|title=About HUNGERBALL {{!}} Hungerball|website=hungerball.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-29}}</ref>

== Types of games ==
There are currently two main types of Hungerball games; '''Competition''' and '''Social'''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nzaimsgames.co.nz/hungerball-world-championships/|title=Hungerball World Championships – Anchor AIMS GAMES|website=nzaimsgames.co.nz|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/thiswayup/audio/2018640498/hungerball-a-new-flavour-of-football|title=Hungerball: a new flavour of football|date=2018-04-13|work=Radio New Zealand|access-date=2018-10-29|language=en-nz}}</ref>

During '''competition games''', there are two ways to play:

# There is a fixed time period. The person who has the highest number of goals scored, minus goals conceded wins.
# It is played as an elimination challenge. Upon conceding three goals, the player is eliminated until there is only one left, who is then the winner.

During social games, players in large groups use a '''fast rotation''' system whereby whoever concedes is replaced by someone in a line waiting to get on the pitch.

There are then multiple social games to play for players which are based on '''training & development.'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thefarleygroup.com/blogs/default.cfm?ww_blogPostID=B7ED94BD-D3CF-835C-AAE3-3215A00F326E|title=4 New Soccer Derived Sports You’ve Never Heard Of|website=The Farley Group|access-date=2018-10-29}}</ref>

The rules are outlined below:

'''“ Singles – 1v1 x 6 (Hungerball meets Soccer)'''

* Dice throw decides which of the six players starts from the centre.
* Other players to remain in their goals, can come out once the ball is touched.
* One ball, no hands.
* Players can score in any of the other five goals.
* One point added for each goal scored, one point taken off for goal conceded.
* Own goal counts as goal conceded (only).
* Player who concedes a goal resumes play from the centre.
* Handball sanctioned with penalty shot to empty goal of guilty player from goal of player who last touched ball prior to hand ball.
* Similarly, fault sanctioned with penalty shot into empty goal of guilty player.
* If responsibility or benefit of fault or handball unable to be established, dice throw to decide who resumes play.

'''Team'''

* 2v2 x3 – two goals per team – similar to challenges for individuals.
* 3v3 – three goals per team, best team wins.”<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.topendsports.com/sport/new/hungerball-soccer.htm|title=The New Sport of Hungerball Soccer|website=topendsports.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-30}}</ref>

'''Field hockey adaptation'''

In its home country, Hungerball has been adapted to field hockey. It plays with the same rules as the soccer version but with the inclusion of a hockey ball and bat per player instead of a conventional football.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.topendsports.com/sport/new/hungerball-hockey.htm|title=New Sport: Hungerball Hockey|website=topendsports.com|access-date=2019-01-10}}</ref>
