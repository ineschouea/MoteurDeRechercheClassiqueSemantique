The '''curlew sandpiper''' (''Calidris ferruginea'') is a small [[wader]] that breeds on the [[tundra]] of [[Arctic]] [[Siberia]].<ref>{{cite news |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/21/birdwatch-migration-curlew-sandpiper |date=21 September 2014 |title=Birdwatch: Curlew sandpiper |author=Stephen Moss}}</ref> The genus name is from [[Ancient Greek]] ''kalidris'' or ''skalidris'', a term used by [[Aristotle]] for some grey-coloured waterside birds. The specific ''ferruginea'' is from [[Latin]] ''ferrugo, ferruginis'', "iron rust" referring to its colour in breeding plumage.<ref name=job>{{cite book | last= Jobling | first= James A | year= 2010| title= The Helm Dictionary of Scientific Bird Names | publisher=Christopher Helm | location = London | isbn = 978-1-4081-2501-4 | pages=84, 159}}</ref>

It is strongly [[bird migration|migratory]], wintering mainly in [[Africa]], but also in south and southeast [[Asia]] and in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_oE29KijRlAC&pg=PA61 |p=61 |title=Bird Migration |author=Thomas Alerstam |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1993}}</ref> It is a [[Vagrancy (biology)|vagrant]] to [[North America]].

==Description==

These birds are small waders, similar to [[dunlin]]s,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rspb.org.uk/birds-and-wildlife/wildlife-guides/bird-a-z/curlew-sandpiper/ |work=RSPB |title=Curlew sandpiper}}</ref> but differ in having a longer down-curved beak, longer neck and legs and a white rump. They have a length of {{convert|18|–|23|cm|in|abbr=on}} and wingspan of {{convert|38|–|41|cm|in|abbr=on}}. The breeding adult has patterned dark grey upperparts and brick-red underparts. In winter, this bird is pale grey above and white below, and shows an obvious white [[supercilium]]. Juveniles have a grey and brown back, a white belly and a peach-coloured breast.

== Behaviour ==
The male curlew sandpiper performs an aerial display during courtship. The clutch of 3–4 eggs are laid in ground scrape in the tundra and taiga, mostly in Siberia.

It is extremely difficult to measure breeding success or population trends in their breeding grounds because nests are scattered over a vast region and their positions influenced by localised weather.

Of all shorebird species, the curlew sandpiper has the smallest breeding range in relation to its non-breeding range. After breeding these birds migrate south to Africa, Australasia or India. South Africa is at the southern limit of the migration path from Siberia, {{convert|15000|km|mi|abbr=on}} or 130° of latitude away.

This wader is highly gregarious, and will form flocks with other calidrid waders, particularly [[dunlin]]. Despite its easterly breeding range, this species is regular on passage in western Europe, presumably because of the southwesterly [[Bird migration|migration]] route.

It [[forage]]s in soft mud on [[marsh]]es and the coast, mainly picking up food by sight. It mostly eats [[insect]]s and other small [[invertebrate]]s.

The numbers of this species (and of [[little stint]]) depend on the population of [[lemming]]s. In poor lemming years, predatory species such as [[skua]]s and [[snowy owl]]s will take Arctic-breeding waders instead.

Counts of the birds in South Africa, specifically at Langebaan Lagoon where they are most numerous, indicate a 40% decline in numbers between 1975 and 2009. A similar trend has been noted in Australia and may be linked to [[effects of global warming]] at the breeding grounds.<ref name=deVilliers2009/>

This species occasionally [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridizes]] with the [[sharp-tailed sandpiper]] and the [[pectoral sandpiper]], producing the presumed "species" called "[[Hybridisation in shorebirds#Cooper's sandpiper|Cooper's sandpiper]]" (''"Calidris"'' × ''cooperi'') and "[[Cox's sandpiper]]" (''"Calidris"'' × ''paramelanotos''), respectively.

==Taxonomy==
This is a fairly unusual species, and has been proposed as [[type species]] of the genus ''Erolia'' but the [[DNA sequence]] data is currently insufficient to resolve its relationships.<ref name=Thomas2004/> This matter is of taxonomic relevance since, as the curlew sandpiper is the type species, a close relationship with the small "[[stint]]" sandpipers would preclude the use of ''Erolia'' for the present species.

The curlew sandpiper is one of the species to which the ''Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds'' ([[AEWA]]) applies.
