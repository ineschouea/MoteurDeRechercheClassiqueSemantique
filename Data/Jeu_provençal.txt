'''''{{lang|fr|Jeu {{sic|hide=y|provençal|reason=French does not capitalize adjectival forms of proper names.}}}}''''' ('game of [[Provence]]'; also known as '''''{{lang|fr|boule {{sic|hide=y|lyonnaise|reason=French does not capitalize adjectival forms of proper names.}}}}''''', "boules of [[Lyon]]") is a  [[France|French]] form of [[boules]].

In [[Italy]], the sport ''{{lang|it|[[bocce volo]]}}'', which is played with bronze balls, follows a similar set of rules.<ref name="petanque-italiangames">[http://www.petanque.org/around_the_world/italian.shtml Petanque.org - Italian Games] (accessed 18 May 2008)</ref>

==History==
The current version of the game developed during the 18th century around the area of [[Lyon]].

* The {{lang|fr|Fédération Lyonnaise et Régionale}} was formed in 1906.  
* About the same time, in 1907, the sport of ''{{lang|fr|[[pétanque]]}}'' split off to become its own sport.
* It led to the formation of {{lang|fr|Fédération Nationale des Boules}} in 1933.
* That became the {{lang|fr|Fédération Française de Boules}} in 1942.

==Rules==
{{Expand section|date=October 2015|with=a full explanation of the rules|reason=Article has to stand on its own, not in relation to the pétanque article, so it needs to provide all the rules here.}}
The rules are similar to the game of ''{{lang|fr|pétanque}}'' except that: 
* A ''{{lang|fr|jeu provençal}}'' court is about twice the size of a ''{{lang|fr|pétanque}}'' court.
* In ''{{lang|fr|jeu provençal}}'', the normal practice is to take a short run-up to the throw. (In ''{{lang|fr|pétanque}}'', the feet are fixed in one spot while throwing.) 

These differences reflect the reason that ''{{lang|fr|pétanque}}'' was invented &ndash; to create a sport that was accessible to a disabled player in a wheelchair.

In addition:
* in ''{{lang|fr|jeu provençal}}'' (as in ''{{lang|it|bocce}}''), each player has four boules when playing as singles (in ''{{lang|fr|pétanque}}'', each has three). 

==Grounds and equipment==
Under official rules, the court must measure {{convert|27.5|m|yd}} in length and between {{convert|2.5|to|4|m|yd}} in width, with a clear play area of {{convert|12.5|m|yd}} and {{convert|7.5|m|yd}} at each end (one end is the Landing zone, and the other is where the players stand and throw).

When the jack is thrown, it must land at least {{convert|12.5|m|yd}} away from the player.

==Boules==

The boules vary in size, weight, and composition, usually to accommodate the player's comfort, but tend to be made of bronze (with the jack being wooden) and are usually {{convert|90|to|110|mm|in}} in diameter and weigh {{convert|900|to|1200|g|lb}}.<ref>[http://www.boccevolo.com/about/ch1.html www.BocceVolo.com - Official Rules - Chapter 1 - Materials]</ref> They must be centrally balanced.
