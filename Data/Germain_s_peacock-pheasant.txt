'''Germain's peacock-pheasant''' (''Polyplectron germaini'') is a pheasant that is endemic to Indochina. The name commemorates the [[France|French]] colonial army's veterinary surgeon Louis Rodolphe Germain.

==Description==
The bird is a medium-sized, approximately 60&nbsp;cm long, brownish dark [[pheasant]] with finely spotted buff, short crest, bare red facial skin, brown [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] and purplish-blue [[ocelli]] on upperbody plumage and half of its tail of twenty feathers. Both sexes are similar. The female has eighteen tail feathers and is smaller than male.

==Taxonomy==
The [[phylogeny]] of this species is somewhat enigmatic. [[mtDNA]] [[cytochrome b|cytochrome ''b'']] and [[D-loop]] as well as the [[nuclear DNA|nuclear]] [[ovomucoid]] [[intron]] G data confirms that it belongs to a [[clade]] together with the [[grey peacock-pheasant]], but also the "brown" southernly species [[bronze-tailed peacock-pheasant]] and [[mountain peacock-pheasant]]. [[Biogeography]] suggests that it may indeed be the most ancient form in its clade, [[speciation|speciating]] [[parapatric]]ally or [[peripatric]]ally in [[Cochinchina]] (Kimball ''et al.'' 2001). This probably took place in the [[Late Pliocene]], roughly 4-3 [[mya (unit)|mya]].<ref>
Note that the [[molecular clock]] calibration method used by Kimball ''et al.'' (2001) is now known to be inappropriate, yielding far too low estimates in galliform birds.</ref>

==Distribution and habitat==
The Germain's peacock-pheasant is [[endemism in birds|endemic]] to southern [[Indochina]]. It is found in the [[seasonal tropical forest]]s of mid-southern [[Vietnam]] and far eastern [[Cambodia]]; it can be found readily in [[Cat Tien National Park]]. The female usually lays two creamy-white eggs.

==Status and conservation==
Due to ongoing habitat loss and limited range, the Germain's peacock-pheasant is evaluated as Near Threatened on the [[IUCN Red List]] of Threatened Species. It is listed on Appendix II of [[CITES]].
