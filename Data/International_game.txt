The '''International game''' ({{lang-ca-valencia|joc internacional}}, {{IPA-ca|?d??k ?inte?nasi.o?nal|IPA}}) is a [[ball game]] modality that joins up many sports allegedly derived from the [[Jeu de paume]]. It's played in the [[Handball International Championships]] by teams from the [[Americas]] and [[Europe]].

== History ==
The ''International game'' was created so that players from similar sports could play with some minimal changes in their respective rules by the [[International Ball game Confederation]].

In first instance, it was made by European federations of different and until then isolated sports:
* [[Belgium]]: [[Balle pelote]]
* [[France]]: [[Longue paume]]
* [[Italy]]: [[Pallone]]
* [[Valencian Community]]: [[Llargues]]
* [[Netherlands]]: [[Frisian handball]]

Later on, some countries from the [[Americas]] joined:
* [[Argentina]]: 
* [[Colombia]]: [[Chazas]]
* [[Ecuador]]:
* [[Mexico]]: [[Pelota tarasca]]
* [[Uruguay]]:

== Playing area ==
''International game'' is played on a rectangular, flat surface ([[lawn|grass]]), 70 m long and 20 m wide for men (15 m at the "service" end). The endings of this rectangle are the "service" and the "receive" lines. In the "service" field there is an 8 x 8 m area, that's the "service box".

For women, the rectangular is 60 m long and 15 m wide with a service box 6 x 6 m.

== Ball ==
Every [[ball game]] is played with a different ball, and when writing the rules of this new sport a ball everybody could feel comfortable with was searched. Not as small and tough as the Valencian ''badana'' or as big and heavy as the Italian one.

It's played with a white rubber ball. No gloves but protections like a layer of esparadrapo or a glove of One Wall are allowed.

== Rules ==
Two teams formed by 5 players play to score more games by hitting a ball with the hand.

Every point consists in four points: 15, 30, 40 and game.

Every point begins when a rotating player from the team at the "service" field throws the ball from the "service box", after that players hit it in order to send it behind the opponent's end line or, at least, move it as far as possible.

If on the serve the ball surpassed the midfield the ball must be hit on the air or after the first rebound on the ground, but if the ball arrives bouncing before the midfield then there is no one-rebound limit.

3 points are involved by party. The team which gains the victory, obtains 2 points if the score is 6-3, 6-4 or 6-5 (1 point for the looser) but the team obtains 3 points if the score is 6-0, 6-1 or 6-2.

The champion of this modality is the team which has most point.

=== International competition of Llargues <ref>[http://www.cijb.info/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=278&Itemid=60  game of Llargues on C.I.J.B]</ref> ===

The [[llargues]] is a Valencian pilota modality which takes place in the street. The Internacional Ball Game Federation established rules to make an international sport by making him play on a ground used for the [[Balle pelote]].

When a team gets two "lines", or the score is "40 and 1 line", both teams must change their respective midfields.

The point may be attain directly or postponed.
* Direct points are obtained:
** When the ball surpasses the opponent's end line.
** When an opponent player hits the ball but it doesn't advance.
** When a player hits the ball with any other part of the body but the hand, except in case of blocking the ball.
* Postponed points are those got when winning the "line".

'''Lines:'''
''Lines'' are a signal resting on a side of the field marking the place where a ball has been blocked so that it didn't advance any more in the defending team's area. When teams swap midfields (and, by that, passing to serve) the new serving team tries to attain the ''lines'' they did at the "receive field". In order to get them they must throw the ball surpassing that ''line'' so that it's blocked behind that line, then the postponed point is scored. If they don't get to send it so far or it's blocked in their own side of the ''line'' then it's the opponent team who obtains the point.
