{{Nihongo|'''''Yukigassen'''''|???}} is a [[snowball fight|snowball fighting-competition]] from Japan. Today there are annual tournaments in [[S?betsu]], [[Hokkaid?]] in Japan, [[Kemijärvi]] in [[Finland]], [[Vardø]] in Norway, [[Murmansk]] in Russia, [[Mount Buller, Victoria]] in Australia, [[Luleå]] in Sweden, [[Anchorage]] in [[Alaska]], [[Aparan]] in [[Armenia]], [[Jasper, Alberta]] and [[Saskatoon, Saskatchewan]] in Canada.

The word consists of the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] words '''yuki''' ([[snow]]) and '''kassen''' ([[wiktionary:battle|battle]]) with [[rendaku]]. Hence ''yukigassen'' means '''snow battle''', but is a common term for 'snowball fight' in Japanese.

==Gameplay==
Yukigassen is a game between two teams with seven players each. The game is played on a court with certain measurements, and the winner is determined through rules made by the [[Japan Yukigassen Federation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yukigassen.jp/english/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=April 23, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060221220654/http://www.yukigassen.jp/english/index.html |archivedate=February 21, 2006 }}</ref>  It is similar to [[capture the flag]]; players are eliminated when hit with snowballs.
