'''Picigin''' ({{IPA-sh|pit?s?gi?n|hr}}<ref>{{cite web|title=Hrvatski jezi?ni portal|url=http://hjp.novi-liber.hr/index.php?show=search_by_id&id=eV5jXRk%3D&keyword=picigin|accessdate=13 June 2015}}</ref>) is traditional ball game from [[Split (city)|Split]], [[Croatia]] that is played on the [[beach]]. It is an amateur sport played in shallow water consisting of players keeping a small ball from touching the water.

==Origin==
[[File:Picigin Crikvenica 011007.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A game of picigin]]
Picigin originated on the sandy beach of [[Ba?vice]] in Split.<ref>[http://www.ceeol.com/aspx/issuedetails.aspx?issueid=f00651e0-c138-47e7-b522-b7d77322d680&articleId=e8c9646d-fdfe-4b8d-b40b-9fa809b36aa1 Dežulovi? Boris - Ba?vice, God's Fingerprint, Phantom of Freedom (1-2/2004)]</ref> It was first played in 1908 by a group of Croatian students from [[Prague]] who were finding it difficult to play the game of [[water polo]] in the shallow water.<ref name="picigin">{{cite web|url=http://www.croatia-expert.com/about-us/picigin/ |title=Picigin Bacvice beach in Split}}</ref> Instead, they began playing a different game which would come to be known as picigin. 

==Description==
The game involves several players in a circle batting around a small ball with their hands; the objective is to keep the ball in the air and out of the water for as long as possible. Players don't catch the ball, they bounce it around with the palm of the hand. As such, the game somewhat resembles net-less [[volleyball]], but is played with a much smaller ball, usually a peeled tennis ball. There is no set number of players, though five is usually average. Much running and diving is done in order to keep the ball from going in the shallow water. Picigin is considered a non-competitive sport: there are no opposing sides, no points, neither winners nor losers. It is generally viewed as a relaxing and fun game, and many take the opportunity to make extravagant leaps and acrobatic manoeuvrings to keep the ball in play.<ref>[http://www.timeout.com/split/features/807/splits-best-beach-game Split's best beach game] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105012154/http://www.timeout.com/split/features/807/splits-best-beach-game |date=2012-01-05 }}</ref> 

===Rules===
Since picigin is an amateur sport, there are no strict or formal rules, but it is played according to tradition, with little variation, but the main goal is to keep ball in the air as long as possible.



====Players====
There are usually five players in the game. Two of them are called ''sidruni'' (sidro = anchor, they are called so because they do not move from their places) and the other three are runners (''trka?i''). The groups are often mixed both by gender and age.

====Terrain====
Picigin must be played on a sandy beach in shallow water. The beach must be sandy because otherwise players could easily get hurt. It is best if the water is ankle-deep, because of mobility and also to soften falls, which are common because there's a lot of jumping around trying to reach the ball.

====Ball====
The traditional ball, called ''balun'' (otherwise a dialectal name for a ball, but this name is strictly used, especially by expert players) is actually a peeled onion, polished off a few millimeters. This kind of ball is best suited for bouncing. It is smooth and lighter than a normal tennis ball.

==Tradition==
The most traditional players believe it to be impossible to play picigin anywhere but on the sandy beach of Ba?vice in [[Split (city)|Split]], which is considered the game's spiritual home.<ref>[http://www.timeout.com/split/features/807/splits-best-beach-game Split's best Beach game] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105012154/http://www.timeout.com/split/features/807/splits-best-beach-game |date=2012-01-05 }}</ref> 

Picigin is played on Ba?vice year round and, often at night in the summer (reflectors can be used in the dark). There is also a long-standing tradition of playing picigin on [[New Year's Day]] regardless of weather conditions, when the sea temperature is rarely above 10&nbsp;[[Celsius|°C]].

In June 2008, picigin was pronounced a [[Croatia]]n immaterial cultural good, for a period of three years, and it is planned to get a permanent protection after that.<ref>[http://dnevnik.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/split-odrzano-prvenstvo-u-piciginu-pobijedila-ekupa-suncanica.html An article in Croatian about picigin]</ref>

===Championships===
Since 2005, the Picigin World Championship in picigin (''Prvenstvo svita u piciginu'') is organized every year on Ba?vice beach in Split.<ref>[http://www.slobodnadalmacija.hr/Split/tabid/72/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/140520/Default.aspx Na Ba?ama održano sedmo Prvenstvo svita u piciginu] </ref> Until 2008, players were given a task to do certain jumps, but from 2008, the winner is selected according to the artistic impression of a whole group.

In Herceg Novi, Winter Picigin tournament is included Mimosa Festival (organized in February).
