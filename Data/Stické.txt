'''Stické''', also called '''stické tennis''', is an indoor [[List of sports#Racket sports|racquet sport]] invented in the late 19th century merging aspects of [[real tennis]], [[racquets (sport)|racquets]] and [[tennis|lawn tennis]].  It derives from {{lang|grc-Latn|[[wiktionary:sphairistikè|sphairistikè]]}} ([[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] meaning "the art of playing ball"), the term originally given to lawn tennis by [[Walter Clopton Wingfield]].

==Manner of play==
Stické is played with standard lawn tennis [[racquet]]s and low pressure balls in an enclosed court.  The court is somewhat similar to a real tennis court in shape, but is smaller (about 78 feet by 27 feet) and different in construction.  Play takes place using all the basics of lawn tennis and the same scoring system, with the addition of side and back walls.  Players face each other over the net in pairs. 

As in real tennis, there is a ''penthouse,'' used throughout the game as a playing surface and on which the service has to land to start each point.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Sarah Jones|title=Forget tennis, anyone for Stické?|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/wiltshire/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_8320000/8320586.stm|publisher=BBC|date=22 October 2009}}</ref> Some courts have a penthouse only down the side, while others have a penthouse at both ends as well. 

==History==
There were over 50 courts built throughout the [[British Empire]] since 1875. The dimensions of the [[Taplow Court]] built by [[William Grenfell, 1st Baron Desborough|Lord Desborough]] in 1892 became the standard. In the early 20th century, stické was a popular recreation at many country houses. At the time it was one of the few games that was played by both men and women.

As of 2005 there are only three playable courts remaining:

* [[Hartham Park]] in [[Corsham]], [[Wiltshire]] ([[England]]). Built in 1904 out of wood.
* [[Knightshayes Court]] in [[Tiverton, Devon|Tiverton]], [[Devon]] (England). Built in 1907 out of wood.
* Viceregal Lodge complex, [[Indian Institute of Advanced Study]], [[Shimla]], [[Himachal Pradesh]] ([[India]]).

Both English courts have active player groups, with an exception of Knightshayes during August to November 2015. During this time, the court was used to present an exhibition on the First World War, as the stické court was used throughout both the world wars as wards for wounded soldiers when the estate was used as a military hospital. The Indian court is primarily used for [[badminton]].

A book about the sport, ''Sticke Tennis'' by Graham Tomkinson, was published in 2004.

A book ''The Rise and Fall of Sticke Tennis 1874-1939'' by Nigel Courtenay à Brassard, was published by Ronaldson Publications in 2017.
