== Etymology ==
Rugby league football takes its name from the bodies that split to create a new form of rugby, distinct from that run by the Rugby [[Football]] Unions, in Britain, Australia and New Zealand between 1895 and 1908.

The first of these, the [[Northern Rugby Football Union]], was established in 1895 as a breakaway faction of England's [[Rugby Football Union]] (RFU). Both organisations played the game under the same rules at first, although the Northern Union began to modify rules almost immediately, thus creating a new faster, stronger paced form of rugby football. Similar breakaway factions split from RFU-affiliated unions in Australia and New Zealand in 1907 and 1908, renaming themselves "rugby football ''league''s" and introducing Northern Union rules.<ref>''[http://www.crusadersrfl.com/page.php?id=419 Why Rugby League?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100120041946/http://www.crusadersrfl.com/page.php?id=419 |date=20 January 2010 }}'' at Crusaders Rugby League website</ref> In 1922, the Northern Union also changed its name to the [[Rugby Football League]]<ref>{{Cite book

}}</ref> Although many factors played a part in the split, including the success of [[working class]] northern teams, the main division was caused by the RFU decision to enforce the amateur principle of the sport, preventing "broken time payments" to players who had taken time off work to play rugby. Northern teams typically had more working class players (coal miners, mill workers etc.) who could not afford to play without this compensation, in contrast to affluent southern teams who had other sources of income to sustain the amateur principle.<ref name="Tony Collins 2006 p.3"/> In 1895, a decree by the RFU banning the playing of rugby at grounds where entrance fees were charged led to twenty-two clubs (including Stockport, who negotiated by telephone) meeting at the [[George Hotel, Huddersfield]] on 29 August 1895 and forming the "Northern Rugby Football Union".<ref>{{Cite book

On 5 May 1954 over 100,000 (official figure 102,569) spectators watched the [[1954 Challenge Cup|1953–54]] [[Challenge Cup]] Final at [[Odsal Stadium]], [[Bradford]], [[England]], setting a new record for attendance at a rugby football match of either code.<ref name=baker/> Also in 1954 the Rugby League World Cup, the first for either code of rugby, was formed at the instigation of the French. In 1966, the [[Rugby League International Federation|International Board]] introduced a rule that a team in possession was allowed three play-the-balls and on the fourth tackle a scrum was to be formed. This was increased to six tackles in 1972 and in 1983 the scrum was replaced by a handover.<ref name="collins2006">{{Cite book|last=Collins|first=Tony|title=Rugby League in Twentieth Century Britain|publisher=Routledge|date=18 April 2006|edition=1|pages=113–114|isbn=978-0-415-39615-8}}</ref> 1967 saw the first professional Sunday matches of rugby league played.

The first sponsors, [[Tetley's Brewery|Joshua Tetley]] and [[John Player]], entered the game for the [[1971–72 Northern Rugby Football League season]]. Television would have an enormous impact on the sport of rugby league in the 1990s when [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s News Corporation sought worldwide broadcasting rights and refused to take no for an answer. The media giant's "Super League" movement saw big changes for the traditional administrators of the game. In Europe, it resulted in a move from a winter sport to a summer one as the new Super League competition tried to expand its market. In Australasia, the [[Super League war]] resulted in long and costly legal battles and changing loyalties, causing significant damage to the code in an extremely competitive sporting market. In 1997 two competitions were run alongside each other in Australia, after which a peace deal in the form of the National Rugby League was formed. The NRL has since become recognised as the sport's flagship competition and since that time has set record TV ratings and crowd figures.<ref name="rleague-attendances-1957-2010">{{cite web |url=http://stats.rleague.com/rl/crowds/summary.html |title=Rugby League Attendances 1957–2010 |publisher=rleague.com |year=2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090408033449/http://stats.rleague.com/rl/crowds/summary.html |archivedate=8 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

==Rules==
===Laws of the game===
[[File:WIN Stadium trial match.jpg|thumb|right|A typical game of rugby league being played.]]
{{Main|Rugby league gameplay|Laws of rugby league}}

The objective in rugby league is to score more points through [[Try|tries]], [[Goal (sport)|goals]] (also known as [[Try#Conversion|conversion]]s) and [[Drop goal (rugby)|field goals]] (also known as drop goals) than the opposition within the 80 minutes of play. If after two halves of play, each consisting of forty minutes, the two teams are [[Tie (draw)|drawing]], a draw may be declared, or the game may enter extra time under the [[golden point]] rule, depending on the relevant competition's format.

The try is the most common form of scoring,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stats.rleague.com/rl/teams/all/overall_ss.html|title=Season Summary|publisher=Rugby League Tables|accessdate=7 April 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100512174712/http://www.stats.rleague.com/rl/teams/all/overall_ss.html|archivedate=12 May 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and a team will usually attempt to score one by running and kicking the ball further upfield or passing from player-to-player in order to manoeuvre around the opposition's defence. A try involves touching the ball to the ground on or beyond the defending team's goal-line and is worth four points. A goal is worth two points and may be gained from a conversion or a penalty. A field goal, or drop goal, is only worth one point and is gained by dropping and then kicking the ball on the [[Drop kick|half volley]] between the uprights in open play.

Teammates, therefore, have to remain on-side by not moving ahead of the player with the ball. However the ball may be kicked ahead for teammates, but again, if they are in front of the kicker when the ball is kicked, they are deemed off-side. Tackling is a key component of rugby league play. Only the player holding the ball may be tackled. A tackle is complete, for example, when the player is held by one or more opposing players
in such a manner that he can make no further progress and cannot part with the ball, or when the player is held by one or more opposing players and the ball or the hand or arm holding the ball comes into contact with the ground.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.playnrl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/ARL-Rules-book-2015.pdf|title=RUGBY LEAGUE LAWS OF THE GAME INTERNATIONAL LEVEL WITH NOTES ON THE LAWS AND NRL TELSTRA PREMIERSHIP INTERPRETATIONS|publisher=PLAYNRL.COM|year=2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304051045/http://www.playnrl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/ARL-Rules-book-2015.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> An attacking team gets a maximum of six tackles to progress up the field before possession is changed over. Once the tackle is completed, the ball-carrier must be allowed to get to his feet to '[[play-the-ball]]'. Ball control is also important in rugby league, as a fumble of the ball on the ground forces a handover, unless the ball is fumbled backwards. The ball can also be turned over by going over the sideline.

===Comparison with rugby union===
{{main|Comparison of rugby league and rugby union}}
The comparison with [[rugby union]] is possible because of the games' similarities and shared origins; however, they remain two distinctly different sports.

The inherent similarities between rugby league and rugby union have at times led to the possibility of a merger of the two variants<ref name="thisislondon2000">{{Cite news| last = Jones   | first = Chris  | title = It's all a code merger mystery  | work = [[London Evening Standard]]  | place = UK  | publisher = ES London Limited  | date = 9 October 2000  | url = http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/sport/article-849199-its-all-a-code-merger-mystery.do  | accessdate =21 September 2010}}</ref> and experimental [[hybrid sports|hybrid games]] have been played that use a mix of the two sports' rules.<ref name="growden1">{{cite news|last=Growden|first=Greg|title=Hybrid rugby union-league experiment|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/rugby/news/4994642/Hybrid-rugby-union-league-experiment|accessdate=22 June 2012|newspaper=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=12 May 2011}}</ref>

{{Main|Rugby league positions}}

Players on the pitch are divided into [[Rugby league positions#Forwards|forwards]] and [[Rugby league positions#Backs|backs]], although the game's rules apply to all players the same way. Each position has a designated number to identify himself from other players. These numbers help to identify which position a person is playing. The system of numbering players is different depending on which country the match is played in. In Australia and New Zealand, each player is usually given a number corresponding to their playing position on the field. However, since 1996 European teams have been able to grant players specific squad numbers,  which they keep without regard to the position they play, similarly to [[association football]].<ref name="SLnumbers">{{citation|publisher=''theRFL''|title='history of the sport' in 1996|url=http://www.therfl.co.uk/about/page.php?areaid=46|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922085622/http://www.therfl.co.uk/about/page.php?areaid=46|archivedate=22 September 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Substitutes (generally referred to as "the bench") are allowed in the sport, and are typically used when a player gets [[Fatigue (medical)|tired]] or [[Injury|injured]], although they can also be used tactically. Each team is currently allowed four substitutes, and in Australia and New Zealand, these players occupy shirt numbers 14 to 22.<ref name="SLnumbers2">{{citation|publisher=''This is rugby'' |title='rugby league playing guide' squad numbers |url=http://www.thisisrugby.info/servlets/template?FILE=rugby-league-guide&navid=17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090731131603/http://www.thisisrugby.info/servlets/template?FILE=rugby-league-guide&navid=17 |archivedate=31 July 2009 }}</ref> There are no limitations on which players must occupy these interchangeable slots. Generally, twelve interchanges are allowed in any game from each team, although in the National Rugby League, this was reduced to ten prior to the 2008 season<ref name="NRLtensubs">{{cite web|url=http://www.leagueunlimited.com/article.php?newsid=15023|title=League rule changes for 2008|publisher=''www.leagueunlimited.com'' (League Unlimited)|accessdate=18 June 2009|last=|first=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216224450/http://www.leagueunlimited.com/article.php?newsid=15023|archivedate=16 February 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and further reduced to eight prior to the 2016 season. If a team has to interchange a player due to the [[Blood replacement|blood bin]] rule or due to injury, and this was the result of misconduct from the opposing team, the compromised team does not have to use one of its allocated interchanges to take the player in question off the field.

===Backs===
The backs are generally smaller, faster and more agile than the forwards. They are often the most creative and evasive players on the field, relying on running, kicking and handling skills, as well as tactics and set plays, to break the defensive line, instead of brute force. Generally forwards do the majority of the work (hit-ups/tackling).

* The title of ''[[Fullback (rugby league)|fullback]]'' (numbered '''1''') comes from the fullback's defensive position where the player drops out of the defensive line to cover the rear from kicks and runners breaking the line. They therefore usually are good ball catchers and clinical tacklers. In attack, the fullback will typically make runs into the attack or support a runner in anticipation of a pass out of the tackle. Fullbacks can play a role in attack similar to a halfback or five-eighth and the fact that the fullback does not have to defend in the first defensive line means that a coach can keep a playmaker from the tackling responsibilities of the first line whilst allowing them to retain their attacking role.
* The ''[[Rugby league positions#Wingers|wingers]]'' (numbered '''2''' and '''5''') are normally the fastest players in a team and play on the far left and right fringes of the field (the wings). Their main task is to receive passes and score tries. The wingers also drop back on the last tackle to cover the left and right sides of the field for kicks while the fullback covers the middle.
*The ''[[Center (rugby)|centres]]'' (numbered '''3''' and '''4''') are positioned one in from the wings and together complete what is known as the three-quarter line. Usually the best mixture of power and vision, their main role is to try to create attacking opportunities for their team and defend against those of the opposition. Along with the wingers, the centres score plenty of tries throughout a season. They usually have a large build and therefore can often play in the [[Second-row forward|second row forwards]].
Usually, the stand-off/five-eighth and scrum-half/half-back are a team's creative unit or 'playmakers'. During the interactions between a team's 'key' players (five-eighth, half-back, fullback, lock forward, and hooker), the five-eighth and half-back will usually be involved in most passing moves. These two positions are commonly called the "halves".
* The stand-off half, or [[five-eighth]] (numbered '''6'''): There is not much difference between the stand-off half and the scrum half ([[Scrum-half (rugby league)|halfback]]), in that both players may operate in front of the pack during 'forward play' (as prime receiver ['''7'''] and shadow receiver ['''6'''], one on each side of the ruck, or both on same side of the ruck), and both players may operate in front of the backs during 'back play' (as prime pivot ['''6'''] and shadow pivot ['''7'''], one on each side of the pack, or both on same side of the ruck / pack). The Five-Eighth position is named with regard to the distance that the player stands in relevance to the team.
* The [[Scrum-half (rugby league)|halfback]] (numbered '''7'''): There is not much difference between the halfback and the five-eighth, in that both players may operate in front of the pack during 'forward play' (as prime receiver ['''7'''] and shadow receiver ['''6'''], one on each side of the ruck, or both on same side of the ruck). Both players may operate in front of the backs during 'back play' (as prime pivot ['''6'''] and shadow pivot ['''7'''], one on each side of the ruck/pack, or both on same side of the ruck/pack). The halfback position is named with regard to halfway between the fullback and the forwards.

===Forwards===
[[File:Ftwins.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Rugby league is noted for its hard physical play]]
The forwards' two responsibilities can be broken into "normal play" and "scrum play". For information on a forward's role in the scrum see [[scrum (rugby)#Rugby league|rugby league scrummage]]. Forward positions are traditionally named after the player's position in the scrum yet are equal with respect to "normal play" with the exception of the hooker. Forward positions are traditionally assigned as follows:
* The ''[[Prop forward|props or front-row forwards]]'' (numbered '''8''' and '''10''') are normally the largest players on field. They are positioned in the centre of the line. The prop will be an "enforcer", dissuading the opposition from attacking the centre of the defensive line and, in attack, will give the team momentum by taking the ball up to the defence aggressively.
* The ''[[Hooker (rugby league)|hooker]]'' (numbered '''9''') is most likely to play the role of [[Rugby league positions#dummy half|dummy half]]. In defence the hooker usually defends in the middle of the line against the opposition's props and second-rowers. The hooker will be responsible for organising the defence in the middle of the field. In attack as dummy-half this player is responsible for starting the play from every play-the-ball by either passing the ball to the right player, or, at opportune moments, running from dummy-half. It is vital that the hooker can pass very well. Traditionally, hookers "hooked" the ball in the scrum. Hookers also make probably more tackles than any other player on the field. The hooker is always involved in the play and needs to be very fit. They need to have a very good knowledge of the game and the players around them.
* The ''[[Second-row forward|second row forwards]]'' (numbered '''11''' and '''12''') The modern day second row is very similar to a centre and is expected to be faster, more mobile and have more skills than the prop and will play amongst the three-quarters, providing strength in attack and defence when the ball is passed out to the wings. Good second-rowers combine the skills and responsibilities of props and centres in the course of the game.
* The ''[[Lock (rugby league)|Loose forward or Lock]]'' (numbered '''13''') is the only forward in the third (last) row of the scrum. They are usually among the fittest players on the field, covering the entire field on both attacking and defending duties. Typically they are big ball-runners who can occasionally slot in as a passing link or kick option; it is not uncommon for locks to have the skills of a [[five-eighth]] and to play a similar role in the team.

The two most prominent full-time professional leagues are the [[Australasia]]n [[National Rugby League]] and the [[Super League]] and to a lesser extent the semi professional French [[Elite One Championship]] and [[Elite Two Championship]]. Domestic leagues, with some full-time exceptions, exist at a semi-professional level below the NRL and Super League, in Australia the [[Queensland Cup]] (which includes a team from Papua New Guinea) and [[NSW Cup]], which provides players to various NRL teams. In the [[United Kingdom]] below Super League is the [[Championship (rugby league)|Championship]] and [[League 1 (rugby league)|League 1]] (the professional system includes 2 [[Wales|Welsh]] teams, 2 [[France|French]] and 1 [[Canada|Canadian]] team). 
The [[PNGNRL|Papua New Guinea National Rugby League]] operates as a semi-professional competition as does the [[USA Rugby League]] in the [[United States]] runs semi-professional clubs to some extent in providing supported accommodation for foreign players. In other countries, the game is played at an amateur level.

}}</ref> Although many factors played a part in the split, including the success of [[working class]] northern teams, the main division was caused by the RFU decision to enforce the amateur principle of the sport, preventing "broken time payments" to players who had taken time off work to play rugby. Northern teams typically had more working class players (coal miners, mill workers etc.) who could not afford to play without this compensation, in contrast to affluent southern teams who had other sources of income to sustain the amateur principle.<ref name="Tony Collins 2006 p.3"/> In 1895, a decree by the RFU banning the playing of rugby at grounds where entrance fees were charged led to twenty-two clubs (including Stockport, who negotiated by telephone) meeting at the [[George Hotel, Huddersfield]] on 29 August 1895 and forming the "Northern Rugby Football Union".<ref>{{Cite book

Players on the pitch are divided into [[Rugby league positions#Forwards|forwards]] and [[Rugby league positions#Backs|backs]], although the game's rules apply to all players the same way. Each position has a designated number to identify himself from other players. These numbers help to identify which position a person is playing. The system of numbering players is different depending on which country the match is played in. In Australia and New Zealand, each player is usually given a number corresponding to their playing position on the field. However, since 1996 European teams have been able to grant players specific squad numbers,  which they keep without regard to the position they play, similarly to [[association football]].<ref name="SLnumbers">{{citation|publisher=''theRFL''|title='history of the sport' in 1996|url=http://www.therfl.co.uk/about/page.php?areaid=46|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922085622/http://www.therfl.co.uk/about/page.php?areaid=46|archivedate=22 September 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

The backs are generally smaller, faster and more agile than the forwards. They are often the most creative and evasive players on the field, relying on running, kicking and handling skills, as well as tactics and set plays, to break the defensive line, instead of brute force. Generally forwards do the majority of the work (hit-ups/tackling).

* The title of ''[[Fullback (rugby league)|fullback]]'' (numbered '''1''') comes from the fullback's defensive position where the player drops out of the defensive line to cover the rear from kicks and runners breaking the line. They therefore usually are good ball catchers and clinical tacklers. In attack, the fullback will typically make runs into the attack or support a runner in anticipation of a pass out of the tackle. Fullbacks can play a role in attack similar to a halfback or five-eighth and the fact that the fullback does not have to defend in the first defensive line means that a coach can keep a playmaker from the tackling responsibilities of the first line whilst allowing them to retain their attacking role.

* The ''[[Rugby league positions#Wingers|wingers]]'' (numbered '''2''' and '''5''') are normally the fastest players in a team and play on the far left and right fringes of the field (the wings).

*The ''[[Center (rugby)|centres]]'' (numbered '''3''' and '''4''') are positioned one in from the wings and together complete what is known as the three-quarter line.

Along with the wingers, the centres score plenty of tries throughout a season. They usually have a large build and therefore can often play in the [[Second-row forward|second row forwards]].

Usually, the stand-off/five-eighth and scrum-half/half-back are a team's creative unit or 'playmakers'. During the interactions between a team's 'key' players (five-eighth, half-back, fullback, lock forward, and hooker), the five-eighth and half-back will usually be involved in most passing moves. These two positions are commonly called the "halves".

===Comparison with rugby union===
[[File:Ftwins.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Rugby league is noted for its hard physical play]]
{{main|Comparison of rugby league and rugby union}}
The comparison with [[rugby union]] is possible because of the games' similarities and shared origins; however, they remain two distinctly different sports.
The forwards' two responsibilities can be broken into "normal play" and "scrum play". For information on a forward's role in the scrum see [[scrum (rugby)#Rugby league|rugby league scrummage]]. Forward positions are traditionally named after the player's position in the scrum yet are equal with respect to "normal play" with the exception of the hooker. Forward positions are traditionally assigned as follows:

* The ''[[Prop forward|props or front-row forwards]]'' (numbered '''8''' and '''10''') are normally the largest players on field. They are positioned in the centre of the line. The prop will be an "enforcer", dissuading the opposition from attacking the centre of the defensive line and, in attack, will give the team momentum by taking the ball up to the defence aggressively.
The inherent similarities between rugby league and rugby union have at times led to the possibility of a merger of the two variants<ref name="thisislondon2000">{{Cite news| last = Jones   | first = Chris  | title = It's all a code merger mystery  | work = [[London Evening Standard]]  | place = UK  | publisher = ES London Limited  | date = 9 October 2000  | url = http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/sport/article-849199-its-all-a-code-merger-mystery.do  | accessdate =21 September 2010}}</ref> and experimental [[hybrid sports|hybrid games]] have been played that use a mix of the two sports' rules.<ref name="growden1">{{cite news|last=Growden|first=Greg|title=Hybrid rugby union-league experiment|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/rugby/news/4994642/Hybrid-rugby-union-league-experiment|accessdate=22 June 2012|newspaper=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=12 May 2011}}</ref>
* The ''[[Hooker (rugby league)|hooker]]'' (numbered '''9''') is most likely to play the role of [[Rugby league positions#dummy half|dummy half]]. In defence the hooker usually defends in the middle of the line against the opposition's props and second-rowers. The hooker will be responsible for organising the defence in the middle of the field. In attack as dummy-half this player is responsible for starting the play from every play-the-ball by either passing the ball to the right player, or, at opportune moments, running from dummy-half. It is vital that the hooker can pass very well. Traditionally, hookers "hooked" the ball in the scrum. Hookers also make probably more tackles than any other player on the field. The hooker is always involved in the play and needs to be very fit. They need to have a very good knowledge of the game and the players around them.

* The ''[[Second-row forward|second row forwards]]'' (numbered '''11''' and '''12''') The modern day second row is very similar to a centre and is expected to be faster, more mobile and have more skills than the prop and will play amongst the three-quarters, providing strength in attack and defence when the ball is passed out to the wings. Good second-rowers combine the skills and responsibilities of props and centres in the course of the game.

[[File:Leeds Rhinos1.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.35|[[Leeds Rhinos|Leeds]] playing at the 2008 [[Boxing Day]] friendly against [[Wakefield Trinity]] at [[Headingley Rugby Stadium|Headingley]]]]
* The ''[[Lock (rugby league)|Loose forward or Lock]]'' (numbered '''13''') is the only forward in the third (last) row of the scrum. They are usually among the fittest players on the field, covering the entire field on both attacking and defending duties. Typically they are big ball-runners who can occasionally slot in as a passing link or kick option; it is not uncommon for locks to have the skills of a [[five-eighth]] and to play a similar role in the team.
{{Main|Rugby league positions}}


==Rugby league worldwide==
Players on the pitch are divided into [[Rugby league positions#Forwards|forwards]] and [[Rugby league positions#Backs|backs]], although the game's rules apply to all players the same way. Each position has a designated number to identify himself from other players. These numbers help to identify which position a person is playing. The system of numbering players is different depending on which country the match is played in. In Australia and New Zealand, each player is usually given a number corresponding to their playing position on the field. However, since 1996 European teams have been able to grant players specific squad numbers,  which they keep without regard to the position they play, similarly to [[association football]].<ref name="SLnumbers">{{citation|publisher=''theRFL''|title='history of the sport' in 1996|url=http://www.therfl.co.uk/about/page.php?areaid=46|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922085622/http://www.therfl.co.uk/about/page.php?areaid=46|archivedate=22 September 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Substitutes (generally referred to as "the bench") are allowed in the sport, and are typically used when a player gets [[Fatigue (medical)|tired]] or [[Injury|injured]], although they can also be used tactically. Each team is currently allowed four substitutes, and in Australia and New Zealand, these players occupy shirt numbers 14 to 22.<ref name="SLnumbers2">{{citation|publisher=''This is rugby'' |title='rugby league playing guide' squad numbers |url=http://www.thisisrugby.info/servlets/template?FILE=rugby-league-guide&navid=17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090731131603/http://www.thisisrugby.info/servlets/template?FILE=rugby-league-guide&navid=17 |archivedate=31 July 2009 }}</ref> There are no limitations on which players must occupy these interchangeable slots. Generally, twelve interchanges are allowed in any game from each team, although in the National Rugby League, this was reduced to ten prior to the 2008 season<ref name="NRLtensubs">{{cite web|url=http://www.leagueunlimited.com/article.php?newsid=15023|title=League rule changes for 2008|publisher=''www.leagueunlimited.com'' (League Unlimited)|accessdate=18 June 2009|last=|first=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216224450/http://www.leagueunlimited.com/article.php?newsid=15023|archivedate=16 February 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and further reduced to eight prior to the 2016 season. If a team has to interchange a player due to the [[Blood replacement|blood bin]] rule or due to injury, and this was the result of misconduct from the opposing team, the compromised team does not have to use one of its allocated interchanges to take the player in question off the field.

===Backs===
The backs are generally smaller, faster and more agile than the forwards. They are often the most creative and evasive players on the field, relying on running, kicking and handling skills, as well as tactics and set plays, to break the defensive line, instead of brute force. Generally forwards do the majority of the work (hit-ups/tackling).

* The title of ''[[Fullback (rugby league)|fullback]]'' (numbered '''1''') comes from the fullback's defensive position where the player drops out of the defensive line to cover the rear from kicks and runners breaking the line. They therefore usually are good ball catchers and clinical tacklers. In attack, the fullback will typically make runs into the attack or support a runner in anticipation of a pass out of the tackle. Fullbacks can play a role in attack similar to a halfback or five-eighth and the fact that the fullback does not have to defend in the first defensive line means that a coach can keep a playmaker from the tackling responsibilities of the first line whilst allowing them to retain their attacking role.
* The ''[[Rugby league positions#Wingers|wingers]]'' (numbered '''2''' and '''5''') are normally the fastest players in a team and play on the far left and right fringes of the field (the wings). Their main task is to receive passes and score tries. The wingers also drop back on the last tackle to cover the left and right sides of the field for kicks while the fullback covers the middle.
*The ''[[Center (rugby)|centres]]'' (numbered '''3''' and '''4''') are positioned one in from the wings and together complete what is known as the three-quarter line. Usually the best mixture of power and vision, their main role is to try to create attacking opportunities for their team and defend against those of the opposition. Along with the wingers, the centres score plenty of tries throughout a season. They usually have a large build and therefore can often play in the [[Second-row forward|second row forwards]].
Usually, the stand-off/five-eighth and scrum-half/half-back are a team's creative unit or 'playmakers'. During the interactions between a team's 'key' players (five-eighth, half-back, fullback, lock forward, and hooker), the five-eighth and half-back will usually be involved in most passing moves. These two positions are commonly called the "halves".
* The stand-off half, or [[five-eighth]] (numbered '''6'''): There is not much difference between the stand-off half and the scrum half ([[Scrum-half (rugby league)|halfback]]), in that both players may operate in front of the pack during 'forward play' (as prime receiver ['''7'''] and shadow receiver ['''6'''], one on each side of the ruck, or both on same side of the ruck), and both players may operate in front of the backs during 'back play' (as prime pivot ['''6'''] and shadow pivot ['''7'''], one on each side of the pack, or both on same side of the ruck / pack). The Five-Eighth position is named with regard to the distance that the player stands in relevance to the team.
* The [[Scrum-half (rugby league)|halfback]] (numbered '''7'''): There is not much difference between the halfback and the five-eighth, in that both players may operate in front of the pack during 'forward play' (as prime receiver ['''7'''] and shadow receiver ['''6'''], one on each side of the ruck, or both on same side of the ruck). Both players may operate in front of the backs during 'back play' (as prime pivot ['''6'''] and shadow pivot ['''7'''], one on each side of the ruck/pack, or both on same side of the ruck/pack). The halfback position is named with regard to halfway between the fullback and the forwards.

===Forwards===
[[File:Ftwins.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Rugby league is noted for its hard physical play]]
The forwards' two responsibilities can be broken into "normal play" and "scrum play". For information on a forward's role in the scrum see [[scrum (rugby)#Rugby league|rugby league scrummage]]. Forward positions are traditionally named after the player's position in the scrum yet are equal with respect to "normal play" with the exception of the hooker. Forward positions are traditionally assigned as follows:
* The ''[[Prop forward|props or front-row forwards]]'' (numbered '''8''' and '''10''') are normally the largest players on field. They are positioned in the centre of the line. The prop will be an "enforcer", dissuading the opposition from attacking the centre of the defensive line and, in attack, will give the team momentum by taking the ball up to the defence aggressively.
* The ''[[Hooker (rugby league)|hooker]]'' (numbered '''9''') is most likely to play the role of [[Rugby league positions#dummy half|dummy half]]. In defence the hooker usually defends in the middle of the line against the opposition's props and second-rowers. The hooker will be responsible for organising the defence in the middle of the field. In attack as dummy-half this player is responsible for starting the play from every play-the-ball by either passing the ball to the right player, or, at opportune moments, running from dummy-half. It is vital that the hooker can pass very well. Traditionally, hookers "hooked" the ball in the scrum. Hookers also make probably more tackles than any other player on the field. The hooker is always involved in the play and needs to be very fit. They need to have a very good knowledge of the game and the players around them.
* The ''[[Second-row forward|second row forwards]]'' (numbered '''11''' and '''12''') The modern day second row is very similar to a centre and is expected to be faster, more mobile and have more skills than the prop and will play amongst the three-quarters, providing strength in attack and defence when the ball is passed out to the wings. Good second-rowers combine the skills and responsibilities of props and centres in the course of the game.
* The ''[[Lock (rugby league)|Loose forward or Lock]]'' (numbered '''13''') is the only forward in the third (last) row of the scrum. They are usually among the fittest players on the field, covering the entire field on both attacking and defending duties. Typically they are big ball-runners who can occasionally slot in as a passing link or kick option; it is not uncommon for locks to have the skills of a [[five-eighth]] and to play a similar role in the team.

The two most prominent full-time professional leagues are the [[Australasia]]n [[National Rugby League]] and the [[Super League]] and to a lesser extent the semi professional French [[Elite One Championship]] and [[Elite Two Championship]]. Domestic leagues, with some full-time exceptions, exist at a semi-professional level below the NRL and Super League, in Australia the [[Queensland Cup]] (which includes a team from Papua New Guinea) and [[NSW Cup]], which provides players to various NRL teams. In the [[United Kingdom]] below Super League is the [[Championship (rugby league)|Championship]] and [[League 1 (rugby league)|League 1]] (the professional system includes 2 [[Wales|Welsh]] teams, 2 [[France|French]] and 1 [[Canada|Canadian]] team). 
The [[PNGNRL|Papua New Guinea National Rugby League]] operates as a semi-professional competition as does the [[USA Rugby League]] in the [[United States]] runs semi-professional clubs to some extent in providing supported accommodation for foreign players. In other countries, the game is played at an amateur level.

== Etymology ==
Rugby league football takes its name from the bodies that split to create a new form of rugby, distinct from that run by the Rugby [[Football]] Unions, in Britain, Australia and New Zealand between 1895 and 1908.

The first of these, the [[Northern Rugby Football Union]], was established in 1895 as a breakaway faction of England's [[Rugby Football Union]] (RFU). Both organisations played the game under the same rules at first, although the Northern Union began to modify rules almost immediately, thus creating a new faster, stronger paced form of rugby football. Similar breakaway factions split from RFU-affiliated unions in Australia and New Zealand in 1907 and 1908, renaming themselves "rugby football ''league''s" and introducing Northern Union rules.<ref>''[http://www.crusadersrfl.com/page.php?id=419 Why Rugby League?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100120041946/http://www.crusadersrfl.com/page.php?id=419 |date=20 January 2010 }}'' at Crusaders Rugby League website</ref> In 1922, the Northern Union also changed its name to the [[Rugby Football League]]<ref>{{Cite book

}}</ref> Although many factors played a part in the split, including the success of [[working class]] northern teams, the main division was caused by the RFU decision to enforce the amateur principle of the sport, preventing "broken time payments" to players who had taken time off work to play rugby. Northern teams typically had more working class players (coal miners, mill workers etc.) who could not afford to play without this compensation, in contrast to affluent southern teams who had other sources of income to sustain the amateur principle.<ref name="Tony Collins 2006 p.3"/> In 1895, a decree by the RFU banning the playing of rugby at grounds where entrance fees were charged led to twenty-two clubs (including Stockport, who negotiated by telephone) meeting at the [[George Hotel, Huddersfield]] on 29 August 1895 and forming the "Northern Rugby Football Union".<ref>{{Cite book

This was increased to six tackles in 1972 and in 1983 the scrum was replaced by a handover.<ref name="collins2006">{{Cite book|last=Collins|first=Tony|title=Rugby League in Twentieth Century Britain|publisher=Routledge|date=18 April 2006|edition=1|pages=113–114|isbn=978-0-415-39615-8}}</ref> 1967 saw the first professional Sunday matches of rugby league played.

Television would have an enormous impact on the sport of rugby league in the 1990s when [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s News Corporation sought worldwide broadcasting rights and refused to take no for an answer. The media giant's "Super League" movement saw big changes for the traditional administrators of the game. In Europe, it resulted in a move from a winter sport to a summer one as the new Super League competition tried to expand its market. In Australasia, the [[Super League war]] resulted in long and costly legal battles and changing loyalties, causing significant damage to the code in an extremely competitive sporting market. In 1997 two competitions were run alongside each other in Australia, after which a peace deal in the form of the National Rugby League was formed. The NRL has since become recognised as the sport's flagship competition and since that time has set record TV ratings and crowd figures.<ref name="rleague-attendances-1957-2010">{{cite web |url=http://stats.rleague.com/rl/crowds/summary.html |title=Rugby League Attendances 1957–2010 |publisher=rleague.com |year=2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090408033449/http://stats.rleague.com/rl/crowds/summary.html |archivedate=8 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

The objective in rugby league is to score more points through [[Try|tries]], [[Goal (sport)|goals]] (also known as [[Try#Conversion|conversion]]s) and [[Drop goal (rugby)|field goals]] (also known as drop goals) than the opposition within the 80 minutes of play. If after two halves of play, each consisting of forty minutes, the two teams are [[Tie (draw)|drawing]], a draw may be declared, or the game may enter extra time under the [[golden point]] rule, depending on the relevant competition's format.

A try involves touching the ball to the ground on or beyond the defending team's goal-line and is worth four points. A goal is worth two points and may be gained from a conversion or a penalty. A field goal, or drop goal, is only worth one point and is gained by dropping and then kicking the ball on the [[Drop kick|half volley]] between the uprights in open play.

Teammates, therefore, have to remain on-side by not moving ahead of the player with the ball. However the ball may be kicked ahead for teammates, but again, if they are in front of the kicker when the ball is kicked, they are deemed off-side. Tackling is a key component of rugby league play. Only the player holding the ball may be tackled. A tackle is complete, for example, when the player is held by one or more opposing players

in such a manner that he can make no further progress and cannot part with the ball, or when the player is held by one or more opposing players and the ball or the hand or arm holding the ball comes into contact with the ground.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.playnrl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/ARL-Rules-book-2015.pdf|title=RUGBY LEAGUE LAWS OF THE GAME INTERNATIONAL LEVEL WITH NOTES ON THE LAWS AND NRL TELSTRA PREMIERSHIP INTERPRETATIONS|publisher=PLAYNRL.COM|year=2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304051045/http://www.playnrl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/ARL-Rules-book-2015.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> An attacking team gets a maximum of six tackles to progress up the field before possession is changed over. Once the tackle is completed, the ball-carrier must be allowed to get to his feet to '[[play-the-ball]]'. Ball control is also important in rugby league, as a fumble of the ball on the ground forces a handover, unless the ball is fumbled backwards. The ball can also be turned over by going over the sideline.

{{Main|Rugby league positions}}

Players on the pitch are divided into [[Rugby league positions#Forwards|forwards]] and [[Rugby league positions#Backs|backs]], although the game's rules apply to all players the same way. Each position has a designated number to identify himself from other players. These numbers help to identify which position a person is playing. The system of numbering players is different depending on which country the match is played in. In Australia and New Zealand, each player is usually given a number corresponding to their playing position on the field. However, since 1996 European teams have been able to grant players specific squad numbers,  which they keep without regard to the position they play, similarly to [[association football]].<ref name="SLnumbers">{{citation|publisher=''theRFL''|title='history of the sport' in 1996|url=http://www.therfl.co.uk/about/page.php?areaid=46|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922085622/http://www.therfl.co.uk/about/page.php?areaid=46|archivedate=22 September 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Substitutes (generally referred to as "the bench") are allowed in the sport, and are typically used when a player gets [[Fatigue (medical)|tired]] or [[Injury|injured]], although they can also be used tactically. Each team is currently allowed four substitutes, and in Australia and New Zealand, these players occupy shirt numbers 14 to 22.<ref name="SLnumbers2">{{citation|publisher=''This is rugby'' |title='rugby league playing guide' squad numbers |url=http://www.thisisrugby.info/servlets/template?FILE=rugby-league-guide&navid=17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090731131603/http://www.thisisrugby.info/servlets/template?FILE=rugby-league-guide&navid=17 |archivedate=31 July 2009 }}</ref> There are no limitations on which players must occupy these interchangeable slots. Generally, twelve interchanges are allowed in any game from each team, although in the National Rugby League, this was reduced to ten prior to the 2008 season<ref name="NRLtensubs">{{cite web|url=http://www.leagueunlimited.com/article.php?newsid=15023|title=League rule changes for 2008|publisher=''www.leagueunlimited.com'' (League Unlimited)|accessdate=18 June 2009|last=|first=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216224450/http://www.leagueunlimited.com/article.php?newsid=15023|archivedate=16 February 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and further reduced to eight prior to the 2016 season. If a team has to interchange a player due to the [[Blood replacement|blood bin]] rule or due to injury, and this was the result of misconduct from the opposing team, the compromised team does not have to use one of its allocated interchanges to take the player in question off the field.

===Backs===
The backs are generally smaller, faster and more agile than the forwards. They are often the most creative and evasive players on the field, relying on running, kicking and handling skills, as well as tactics and set plays, to break the defensive line, instead of brute force. Generally forwards do the majority of the work (hit-ups/tackling).

* The title of ''[[Fullback (rugby league)|fullback]]'' (numbered '''1''') comes from the fullback's defensive position where the player drops out of the defensive line to cover the rear from kicks and runners breaking the line. They therefore usually are good ball catchers and clinical tacklers. In attack, the fullback will typically make runs into the attack or support a runner in anticipation of a pass out of the tackle. Fullbacks can play a role in attack similar to a halfback or five-eighth and the fact that the fullback does not have to defend in the first defensive line means that a coach can keep a playmaker from the tackling responsibilities of the first line whilst allowing them to retain their attacking role.
* The ''[[Rugby league positions#Wingers|wingers]]'' (numbered '''2''' and '''5''') are normally the fastest players in a team and play on the far left and right fringes of the field (the wings). Their main task is to receive passes and score tries. The wingers also drop back on the last tackle to cover the left and right sides of the field for kicks while the fullback covers the middle.
*The ''[[Center (rugby)|centres]]'' (numbered '''3''' and '''4''') are positioned one in from the wings and together complete what is known as the three-quarter line. Usually the best mixture of power and vision, their main role is to try to create attacking opportunities for their team and defend against those of the opposition. Along with the wingers, the centres score plenty of tries throughout a season. They usually have a large build and therefore can often play in the [[Second-row forward|second row forwards]].
Usually, the stand-off/five-eighth and scrum-half/half-back are a team's creative unit or 'playmakers'. During the interactions between a team's 'key' players (five-eighth, half-back, fullback, lock forward, and hooker), the five-eighth and half-back will usually be involved in most passing moves. These two positions are commonly called the "halves".

* The stand-off half, or [[five-eighth]] (numbered '''6'''): There is not much difference between the stand-off half and the scrum half ([[Scrum-half (rugby league)|halfback]]), in that both players may operate in front of the pack during 'forward play' (as prime receiver ['''7'''] and shadow receiver ['''6'''], one on each side of the ruck, or both on same side of the ruck), and both players may operate in front of the backs during 'back play' (as prime pivot ['''6'''] and shadow pivot ['''7'''], one on each side of the pack, or both on same side of the ruck / pack). The Five-Eighth position is named with regard to the distance that the player stands in relevance to the team.
* The [[Scrum-half (rugby league)|halfback]] (numbered '''7'''): There is not much difference between the halfback and the five-eighth, in that both players may operate in front of the pack during 'forward play' (as prime receiver ['''7'''] and shadow receiver ['''6'''], one on each side of the ruck, or both on same side of the ruck). Both players may operate in front of the backs during 'back play' (as prime pivot ['''6'''] and shadow pivot ['''7'''], one on each side of the ruck/pack, or both on same side of the ruck/pack). The halfback position is named with regard to halfway between the fullback and the forwards.

===Forwards===
[[File:Ftwins.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Rugby league is noted for its hard physical play]]
The forwards' two responsibilities can be broken into "normal play" and "scrum play". For information on a forward's role in the scrum see [[scrum (rugby)#Rugby league|rugby league scrummage]]. Forward positions are traditionally named after the player's position in the scrum yet are equal with respect to "normal play" with the exception of the hooker. Forward positions are traditionally assigned as follows:
* The ''[[Prop forward|props or front-row forwards]]'' (numbered '''8''' and '''10''') are normally the largest players on field. They are positioned in the centre of the line. The prop will be an "enforcer", dissuading the opposition from attacking the centre of the defensive line and, in attack, will give the team momentum by taking the ball up to the defence aggressively.
* The ''[[Hooker (rugby league)|hooker]]'' (numbered '''9''') is most likely to play the role of [[Rugby league positions#dummy half|dummy half]]. In defence the hooker usually defends in the middle of the line against the opposition's props and second-rowers. The hooker will be responsible for organising the defence in the middle of the field. In attack as dummy-half this player is responsible for starting the play from every play-the-ball by either passing the ball to the right player, or, at opportune moments, running from dummy-half. It is vital that the hooker can pass very well. Traditionally, hookers "hooked" the ball in the scrum. Hookers also make probably more tackles than any other player on the field. The hooker is always involved in the play and needs to be very fit. They need to have a very good knowledge of the game and the players around them.
* The ''[[Second-row forward|second row forwards]]'' (numbered '''11''' and '''12''') The modern day second row is very similar to a centre and is expected to be faster, more mobile and have more skills than the prop and will play amongst the three-quarters, providing strength in attack and defence when the ball is passed out to the wings. Good second-rowers combine the skills and responsibilities of props and centres in the course of the game.
* The ''[[Lock (rugby league)|Loose forward or Lock]]'' (numbered '''13''') is the only forward in the third (last) row of the scrum. They are usually among the fittest players on the field, covering the entire field on both attacking and defending duties. Typically they are big ball-runners who can occasionally slot in as a passing link or kick option; it is not uncommon for locks to have the skills of a [[five-eighth]] and to play a similar role in the team.

The two most prominent full-time professional leagues are the [[Australasia]]n [[National Rugby League]] and the [[Super League]] and to a lesser extent the semi professional French [[Elite One Championship]] and [[Elite Two Championship]]. Domestic leagues, with some full-time exceptions, exist at a semi-professional level below the NRL and Super League, in Australia the [[Queensland Cup]] (which includes a team from Papua New Guinea) and [[NSW Cup]], which provides players to various NRL teams. In the [[United Kingdom]] below Super League is the [[Championship (rugby league)|Championship]] and [[League 1 (rugby league)|League 1]] (the professional system includes 2 [[Wales|Welsh]] teams, 2 [[France|French]] and 1 [[Canada|Canadian]] team). 
The [[PNGNRL|Papua New Guinea National Rugby League]] operates as a semi-professional competition as does the [[USA Rugby League]] in the [[United States]] runs semi-professional clubs to some extent in providing supported accommodation for foreign players. In other countries, the game is played at an amateur level.
