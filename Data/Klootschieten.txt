'''Klootschieten''' ("Ball shooting" in English) is a [[sport in the Netherlands]] and [[East Frisia]], Germany. In the game, participants try to throw a [[ball]] (the '''kloot''') as far as they can. It is most popular in the eastern regions of [[Twente]] and [[Achterhoek]]. It is known in [[Northern Germany]] and the Netherlands. The game is ultimately of [[Frisians|Frisian]] origin.<ref>VƒTH, J., & MATTES, R. ëKlootíshooting in Northern Germany. ''SportñIntegrationñEurope'', 180.</ref> It is a relatively difficult throwing style that requires speed, power, and concentration. The distance of the throw is measured by meters. The sport was connected to betting, drinking and disorderly conduct, often gaining a bad reputation and was banned a few times. Ultimately, this competitive game prevailed. Its first league was developed by Hinrick Dunkhase in 1902.<ref>[http://www.fkv-online.de/images/phocadownload/satzung/Fach_1_-_Satzung_vom_05.03.2010.pdf?phpMyAdmin=oCkkI7fvGYMfqVPcZB4nmz3stq8 Friesischer Klootschieﬂer Verband e.V. ñ Satzung], abgerufen am 30.

== History ==
The Klootschieﬂen likely arose from an ancient [[Frisians|Frisian]] weapon, which the Frisians flung on ships and opponents.<ref name="taz2">[http://www.taz.de/!28175/ ''Klootschieﬂen ñ Der ewige Feldkampf.''] abgerufen am 30. Dezember 2012.</ref> The Frisian fighters are said to have been feared for their missiles. The term ''Kloot'' comes from [[Low German]] and derives from ''Kluten''. In further development of this sport, heavy flint bald and two-pound iron balls were used. Later, the wood from the apple tree was turned into fist-sized balls, which were pierce crosswise. The resulting cavity was filled with lead.

The Dutch reformer Jacobus van Oudenhoven took in 1659 the ''Kloot werpen'' on a Sunday after the service in his ''sins register.''<ref>Jacobus van Oudenhoven: ''Ingebroken Alblasser-waert, in Zuyd-Hollandt''.

De Groot Goudriaan, Kampen 1987, S. 43ñ51.</ref>

In the past, many concomitants were associated with Kloot shooting. So often competitions were held in which were played for money or other valuables. Since the sport was practiced in winter and in earlier times, the sportswear made it possible for deaths from [[pneumonia]]. A lot of alcohol was often consumed during the competition. It was even argued to get bloody at times. Accordingly, the sport was occasionally banned by the authorities, but ultimately the Klootschieﬂen prevailed again and again.

[[:de:Hinrich_Dunkhase|Hinrich Dunkhase]] (1857-1905), in Burhave, [[Butjadingen]], merged the Oldenburg and East Frisian klootschieten for the Friesian klootschieten Association (FRP) on May 25, 1902. <ref name=":0">[http://www.fkv-online.de/images/phocadownload/satzung/Fach_1_-_Satzung_vom_05.03.2010.pdf?phpMyAdmin=oCkkI7fvGYMfqVPcZB4nmz3stq8 Friesischer Klootschieﬂer Verband e.V. ñ Satzung], abgerufen am 30.

In the National Socialist period, the FKV resisted the inclusion in the ''(NS) Reichsbund for physical exercises'' by not imputing to the organizations of sports, but wanted to know the Klootschieﬂen in his tradition as a home and Friesenspiel understood. The FKV joined the ''Nazi cultural community'' and was able to maintain a certain degree of independence. Above all, Low German or Frisian could be spoken at the competition, which was prohibited in a ''sport''. Only after the [[World War II|Second World War]], the FKV oriented again and became a member of the National ''Sports Association'' [[Lower Saxony]] a ''sport.''<ref>[[Arnd Kr¸ger]]: ''Incorporating traditional games into modern sports.

The sport is now also represented in the Landessportb¸nden of NRW ( Klootschieﬂer- and Boﬂelverband North Rhine-Westphalia ) and Schleswig-Holstein. European championships (as ''road bowling'') have been held since 1969 (every four years since 1980) between the Netherlands, Ireland, Northern Ireland and Germany in the disciplines of standing competition, field competition and street riding. In the Netherlands there is the ''Dutch Klootschieters Bond'' (NKB, founded in 1967) and in Ireland the ''Irish Road Bowling Association'' (Irish: ''BÛl Chumann na h…ireann''). (founded in 1954). International umbrella organization is the ''International Bowlplaying Association'' (IBA, founded in 1969). Competitions also take place among Irish immigrants in the US and Canada as it is part of traditional Irish folk culture

==Styles==
There are three styles: field, street, and standing (''veld'', ''straat'', and ''zetten'').

===Field===
In the field (''veld'') version of Klootschieten, it is the intention, alone or in a team, to reach a particular patch of [[grass]] and/or [[sand]] in as few throws as possible (similar in this respect to [[golf]]). The course contains curves and variations of height (small hills and valleys and such), so that skill as well as strength is an important factor.

The field kloot is a round ball of wood or synthetic material, made heavier with [[lead]]. The diameter of the kloot is mostly between 7 and 8 centimetres, but these can deviate according to the preference of the participants. There is a minimum diameter of 5 centimetres.

===Street===
[[Image:Boﬂelstrecke wbkoog.JPG|thumb|left|A road obviously designed for {{Interlanguage link multi|Boﬂeln|de}} in Germany]]

In the street (''straat'') version of Klootschieten, the rules are approximately the same as in the field version, except that the course (being a street, country lane or similar) and the ball (being heavier) are different. An important consideration in the street version is to keep the ball away from obstacles such as ditches, gutters, streams, long grass etc., which would reduce the distance of ones "shoot". The experienced player will sometimes deliberately aim for such places on uphill stretches, to avoid the possibility of the ball rolling back downhill.

===Setting===
The goal in the standing or setting (''zetten'') style is to see how far the ball can travel in the air. Thus the measure of the throw ends at the point where the ball hits the ground (in contrast to the field and street variants).

== Similar sports ==
In Germany a sport similar to field style Klootschieten is played, named "'''Boﬂeln'''" (Bosseln), while '''Klootschieﬂen''' is the German name for the standing style. It is primarily played along the coast and borders of North Germany, such as in [[Ostfriesland]], [[Oldenburg]], [[Butjadingen]], [[Dithmarschen]], [[Nordfriesland]], [[Emsland]], and [[Grafschaft Bentheim]]. It is also played in some parts of the United States by German and Dutch immigrants.

In Ireland, a similar game is played under the name [[Irish road bowling|road bowling]].

===European championship===
In May 2004, the European Championship was held in [[Westerstede]], Germany.

* Rena Ahlrichs (women's, straat)
* Ute Uhrbrook (women's, zetten)

* Henning Feyen (men's, straat)
* Stefan Albarus (men's, zetten)

In May 2008, the European Championships was held near [[Cork (city)|Cork]], Ireland.<ref>[http://www.scannan.ie/bowling.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426031347/http://www.scannan.ie/bowling.html|date=April 26, 2012}}</ref>

== Records ==
For the first time in 1935, the bullet was thrown over the 100-meter mark by Ostfriesen Gerd Gerdes. This record lasted until 1985, when Auricher Harm Henkel threw 102.00 meters. This record was dropped the same day by the "Bear of Ellens" Hans-Georg Bohlken with 105.20 meters. The current (as of January 2006) record is 106.20 meters, held by Stefan Albarus from the north in [[East Frisia]].<ref name="taz22">[http://www.taz.de/!28175/ ''Klootschieﬂen ñ Der ewige Feldkampf.''] abgerufen am 30.

For the first time in 1935, the bullet was thrown over the 100-meter mark by Ostfriesen Gerd Gerdes. This record lasted until 1985, when Auricher Harm Henkel threw 102.00 meters. This record was dropped the same day by the "Bear of Ellens" Hans-Georg Bohlken with 105.20 meters. The current (as of January 2006) record is 106.20 meters, held by Stefan Albarus from the north in [[East Frisia]].<ref name="taz22">[http://www.taz.de/!28175/ ''Klootschieﬂen ñ Der ewige Feldkampf.''] abgerufen am 30.
