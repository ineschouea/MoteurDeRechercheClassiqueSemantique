In Mookie Toys Swingball,  there is a helical coil of wire at the top of the pole and the competitors hit the ball in opposite directions to make it go up or down the coil, the winner being the person who gets the ball to their end of the coil, top or bottom.{{cn|date=October 2014}}

Other commercial swingball toys have a rotating component to attach the string, so that it does not wrap around the pole. <ref>[http://www.outdoortoys.org.uk/swingball.htm "Swingball"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141101041609/http://www.outdoortoys.org.uk/swingball.htm |date=2014-11-01 }} at the outdoortoys.org.uk website</ref>
