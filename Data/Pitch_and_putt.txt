[[File:Pitch and Putt - geograph.org.uk - 245542.jpg|thumb|right|The "par 2" or pitch and putt course in [[Shibden Hall]], [[England]]]]

'''Pitch and putt''' is an [[amateur sport]] very similar to, and derived from, [[golf]], where the hole length is typically up to {{convert|90|m|yd|-1}}<ref>[http://fippa.org/uploads/news/files/Rules_FIPPA_2014.pdf FIPPA Rules 2014]</ref> and just 2-3 clubs are typically used. Invented in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] in 1929, and developed through the 1940s, it is now played in dozens of countries and has two world governing bodies.

==Game play==

For international competitions:
* the maximum hole length is {{convert|90|m|yd|-1}};
* the maximum total course length of {{convert|1200|m|yd|-1}};
* players may only use three [[Golf club (equipment)|clubs]], one of which must be a [[Putter (golf)|putter]].

The game is played from raised artificial teeing surfaces using a tee and it has its own handicap system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pitch-putt.info/index.php/definition-mainmenu-12|title=Pitch and putt rules|publisher=[[European Pitch and Putt Association]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131027233447/http://pitch-putt.info/index.php/definition-mainmenu-12|archivedate=2013-10-27|df=}}</ref> 

Each country can devise its own rules, and there is interaction with some golfing authorities but the sport operates autonomously.

The game was developed mainly in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] since the 1940s but is today a growing sport all over the world. It is organized internationally by the [[European Pitch and Putt Association]] since 1999, by the [[International Pitch and Putt Federation]] since 2006 and by the [[International Pitch and Putt Associations]] since 2009. In all cases pitch and putt has its own handicap system and applies the rules of FIPPA/IPPA with exceptions that are specifically approved in each country.

The [[European Pitch and Putt Association]] (EPPA) was founded at a meeting in Dublin in 1999 by representatives from [[Ireland]], [[Great Britain]], [[Spain]], [[France]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Italy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pitch-putt.info/index.php/history-mainmenu-14|title=History of EPPA|publisher=[[European Pitch and Putt Association|EPPA]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723081840/http://www.pitch-putt.info/index.php/history-mainmenu-14|archivedate=2011-07-23|df=}}</ref> Later, [[Norway]], [[Switzerland]], [[San Marino]], [[Denmark]], [[Andorra]] and [[Germany]] joined the EPPA. The European Pitch and Putt Association stages a biennial [[European Pitch and putt Championship|European Team Championship]].

The [[Federation of International Pitch and Putt Associations]] was created in March 2006 in a meeting in [[Barcelona]] by representatives of 17 pitch and putt associations.  FIPPA members are Ireland, Spain, Norway, Great Britain, Switzerland, Australia, Chile, Andorra, and the United States. Canada, China, and Germany are associated members. The Federation of International Pitch and Putt Associations stages a biennial [[Pitch and Putt World Cup]] and, since 2009, FIPPA the [[Pitch and putt World Strokeplay Championship]].

In 2009, France, Italy, San Marino, and Denmark left FIPPA and EPPA and founded the [[International Pitch and Putt Associations|International Pitch and Putt Association]] (IPPA)<ref>{{cite web|author=FIPPA|title=FIPPA Revamped|url=http://www.fippa.net/news_2009_fipparevamped.shtml|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601072142/http://www.fippa.net/news_2009_fipparevamped.shtml|archivedate=2009-06-01|df=}}</ref> along with Spain and Portugal.{{cn|date=September 2018}}
