'''Bat-and-ball games''' (or '''safe haven games''' to avoid being confused with club games such as [[golf]] and [[hockey]]) are [[playing field|field]] [[game]]s played by two opposing teams.<ref>Usually.  In some games for a small number of players, such as [[Scrub baseball|workup]] and the way [[old cat]] games, there are no teams and players rotate through the positions.</ref> The teams alternate between "batting" (offensive) roles, sometimes called "in at bat", and "out in the field" (defensive), or simply in and out. Only the batting team may score, but teams have equal opportunities in both roles. The game is counted rather than timed.

A player on the fielding (defensive) team puts the ball in play with a delivery whose restriction depends on the game. A player on the batting team attempts to strike the delivered ball, commonly with a "bat", which is a club governed by the rules of the game.  After striking the ball, the batter may become a runner trying to reach a safe haven or "base". While in contact with a base, the runner is safe from the fielding team and in a position to score runs. Leaving a safe haven places the runner in danger of being put out. The teams switch roles when the fielding team puts the batting ''team'' out, which varies by game.

In modern baseball the fielders put three ''players'' out; in cricket they retire all players but one.  Some games permit multiple runners and some have multiple bases to run in sequence. Batting may occur, and running begin, at one of the bases. The movement between those "safe havens" is governed by the rules of the particular sport.
