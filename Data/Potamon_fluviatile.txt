'''''Potamon fluviatile''''' is a [[freshwater crab]] found in or near [[woodland|wooded]] [[stream]]s, [[river]]s and [[lake]]s in [[Southern Europe]]. It is an [[omnivore]] with broad [[ecology|ecological]] tolerances, and adults typically reach {{convert|50|mm|0|abbr=on}} in size during their 10–12 year lifespan. They inhabit burrows and are aggressive, apparently outcompeting native [[crayfish]].

''P.&nbsp;fluviatile'' has been harvested for food since [[classical antiquity]], and is now threatened by [[overexploitation]]. Many of the island populations are particularly vulnerable, and the [[Maltese freshwater crab|Maltese subspecies]] has become a [[Flagship species|conservation icon]]. A population in [[Rome]] may have been brought there before the founding of the [[Roman Empire]].

''Potamon fluviatile'' is edible,<ref name="Pesq"/> as indicated by its alternative [[specific name (zoology)|specific epithet]] ''edulis'',<ref name="Jesse"/> and was known to the [[ancient Greeks]]; it is probably this species which they depicted on medals found at [[Agrigento]], [[Sicily]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=Occurrence of fresh-water crabs, genus ''Potamon'', in Southern France |author=Guy Charmantier |journal=[[Journal of Crustacean Biology]] |volume=12 |issue=4 |year=1992 |pages=620–626 |jstor=1548843 |doi=10.2307/1548843}}</ref> More recently, the species was depicted on the 5¢ coin in the last series of [[Coins of the Maltese lira|Maltese coins]] before the introduction of the [[Euro]] there in 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.centralbankmalta.org/site/currency2h.html |title=Maltese Definitive Issue Coins - Second Series |publisher=[[Central Bank of Malta]] |accessdate=March 15, 2010}}</ref>

== Ecology ==
''Potamon fluviatile'' has a generalist diet, feeding on vegetable debris, scraping [[alga]]e from surfaces, or [[predation|preying]] on [[frog]]s, [[tadpole]]s, and various [[invertebrate]]s, such as [[insect]] [[larva]]e,<ref>{{cite journal |journal=[[Freshwater Biology (journal)|Freshwater Biology]] |year=1989 |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=233–245 |title=Energy maximization and foraging strategies in ''Potamon fluviatile'' (Decapoda, Brachyura) |author1=Francesca Gherardi |author2=Federica Tarducci  |author3=Fiorenza Micheli  |lastauthoramp=yes |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2427.1989.tb01097.x}}</ref> [[snail]]s or [[worm]]s.<ref name="Pesq"/> No predator seems to specialise on ''P.&nbsp;fluviatile'', but a number of animals take it [[opportunistic feeder|opportunistically]], including [[rat]]s, [[fox]]es, [[weasel]]s, [[birds of prey]] and [[Eurasian Jay|jays]].<ref name="Pesq"/> The most significant predator may be mankind, with individual prospectors able to catch 3,000 to 10,000 in one season.<ref name="Pesq"/>

Adults occupy [[burrow]]s, while smaller individuals shelter under stones. The entrances to the burrows may be more than {{convert|5|m|ft|abbr=on}} from the stream's edge and are always above water level. The burrows may be more than {{convert|80|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, and probably serve to protect the crabs from extreme cold.<ref name="Pesq"/>

''Potamon fluviatile'' is an [[aggression|aggressive]] species, mostly attacking with the larger right claw, since 90% of individuals are [[handedness|right-handed]].<ref name="Pesq"/>

In the [[Apennine Mountains|Tosco-Emilian Apennines]], ''P.&nbsp;fluviatile'' is only found south of the watershed, in contrast with the [[crayfish]] ''[[Austropotamobius pallipes]]'', which occurs on both sides on the mountains. Although their ranges overlap, the two species do not inhabit the same water courses, apparently because the crab [[competition (biology)|outcompetes]] the crayfish, which is therefore forced to live in less favourable locations where the crab cannot survive.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=[[Italian Journal of Zoology|Bollettino di Zoologia]] |volume=Suppl.&nbsp;61 |pages=41 |year=1994 |title=Competition and predation between the river crab ''Potamon fluviatile'' and the crayfish ''Austropotamobius pallipes'' |author1=Paola Dardi  |author2=Francesca Gherardi  |lastauthoramp=yes |doi=10.1080/11250009409355977}}</ref> Non-indigenous crayfish may pose a greater threat to ''P.&nbsp;fluviatile'' than native crayfish, although the greatest threats remain [[pollution]], [[overfishing]] and the [[drainage|draining]] of [[wetlands]].<ref name="IUCN"/>

[[File:Eyrwtas.PNG|thumb|right|The [[Eurotas (river)|Evrotas River]], near [[Sparta]] – habitat for ''Potamon fluviatile''|alt=A fast-flowing river in a wide, gravelly bed, flows through woodland.]]
The natural range of ''Potamon fluviatile'' is highly [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmented]], and covers parts of many countries with a [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] coastline. It is found in mainland Italy and on the [[Balkan Peninsula]] from [[Dalmatia]] to the [[Vardar|Axios River]] in [[Greece]].<ref name="Jesse"/> It is also found on a number of islands, including [[Sicily]], [[Malta]] and [[Gozo]], the [[Ionian Islands]], [[Aegean Islands]], [[Sporades]] and [[Andros]] in the [[Cyclades]].<ref name="IUCN"/> Although the species as a whole is widespread, it is declining in numbers, and these insular populations are particularly vulnerable.<ref name="IUCN"/>

===Italy===
''Potamon fluviatile'' is widely distributed in much of mainland Italy, especially in the provinces of [[Trento]], [[Lombardy]], [[Veneto]], [[Liguria]], [[Tuscany]], [[Umbria]], [[Lazio]], [[Campania]], [[Apulia]], and [[Calabria]], as well as on the island of [[Sicily]].<ref name="IUCN"/> Although it used to be found as far north as [[Lake Garda]], ''P.&nbsp;fluviatile'' no longer occurs north of the [[Po (river)|River Po]].<ref name="Jesse">{{cite journal |title=Disjunct distribution of the Mediterranean freshwater crab ''Potamon fluviatile'' — natural expansion or human introduction? |author=Ruth Jesse |author2=Markus Pfenninger |author3=Sara Fratini |author4=Massimiliano Scalici |author5=Bruno Streit |author6=Christoph D.

In 1997 a population of ''P.&nbsp;fluviatile'' was discovered under the ruins of [[Trajan's Forum]] in the heart of [[Rome]], living in canals built by the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] which connect to the ''[[Cloaca Maxima]]''.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.co.uk/news/2007/06/070604-crabs-picture.html |title=Photo in the News: "Ancient" Crabs Live on in Roman Ruins |date=June 4, 2007 |publisher=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]}}</ref> Based on a [[genetic analysis]], which demonstrated that these crabs were similar to those in [[Greece]], researchers believe that they had been brought by the Greeks before the founding of the city, some 3000 years ago. The crabs' unusual size, up to {{convert|12|cm|in|abbr=on}}, and [[longevity]] (up to 15&nbsp;years) are also interpreted as evidence of a long-established population, by analogy with [[island gigantism]].<ref name="Cosmos">{{cite news |url=http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/news/1375/freshwater-crabs-thrive-roman-ruins |title=Freshwater crabs thrive in Roman ruins |publisher=[[Cosmos (magazine)|Cosmos]] |date=June 8, 2007}}</ref>
