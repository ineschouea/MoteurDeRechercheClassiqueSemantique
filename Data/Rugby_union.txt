'''Rugby union''', commonly known in most of the world simply as '''rugby''',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.worldrugby.org/welcome-to-rugby/what-is-rugby|title=What is Rugby?|publisher=World Rugby|accessdate=28 March 2018}}</ref> is a [[Contact sport#Terminology|contact]] [[team sport]] which originated in [[England]] in the first half of the 19th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/originsofrugby.htm#2 |title=Origins of Rugby&nbsp;– Codification "The innovation of running with the ball was introduced some time between 1820 and 1830." |publisher=Rugbyfootballhistory.com |accessdate=15 August 2011}}</ref> One of the [[Comparison of rugby league and rugby union|two codes]] of [[rugby football]], it is based on running with the ball in hand.  In its most common form, a game is between two teams of 15 players using an oval-shaped [[rugby ball|ball]] on a rectangular field with H-shaped goalposts at each end.

Rugby union is a popular sport around the world, played by male and female players of all ages. In 2014, there were more than 6 million people playing worldwide, of whom 2.36 million were registered players. [[World Rugby]], previously called the International Rugby Football Board (IRFB) and the International Rugby Board (IRB), has been the governing body for rugby union since 1886, and currently has 101 countries as full members and 18 associate members.

In 1845, the first football laws were written by [[Rugby School]] pupils; other significant events in the early development of rugby include the [[Blackheath F.C.|Blackheath Club]]'s decision to leave [[the Football Association]] in 1863 and the [[History of rugby league|split]] between rugby union and [[rugby league]] in 1895.  Historically an amateur sport, in 1995 restrictions on payments to players were removed, making the game openly professional at the highest level for the first time.<ref>{{cite news|last=Scianitti|first=Matthew|title=The world awaits for Canada's rugby team|url=http://sports.nationalpost.com/2011/06/18/the-world-awaits-for-canadas-rugby-team/|accessdate=22 March 2015|newspaper=[[National Post]]|date=18 June 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130129194424/http://sports.nationalpost.com/2011/06/18/the-world-awaits-for-canadas-rugby-team/|archivedate=29 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Rugby union spread from the [[Home Nations]] of Great Britain and Ireland and was absorbed by many of the countries associated with the [[British Empire]]. Early exponents of the sport included Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and France. Countries that have adopted rugby union as their ''de facto'' [[national sport]] include Fiji, Georgia, Madagascar,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.irb.com/newsmedia/regional/newsid=53025.html |accessdate=1 December 2013 |title=Madagascar take Sevens honours |date=23 August 2007 |publisher=International Rugby Board |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AGpxxkZd?url=http://www.irb.com/newsmedia/regional/newsid=53025.html |archivedate=29 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref> New Zealand, Samoa and Tonga.

International matches have taken place since 1871 when the first game took place between Scotland and England at Raeburn Place in Edinburgh. The [[Rugby World Cup]], first held in 1987, takes place every four years. The [[Six Nations Championship]] in Europe and [[The Rugby Championship]] in the Southern Hemisphere are other major international competitions, held annually.

National club or provincial competitions include the [[Premiership Rugby|Premiership]] in England, the [[Top 14]] in France, the [[Mitre 10 Cup]] in New Zealand, the [[National Rugby Championship]] in Australia, and the [[Currie Cup]] in South Africa. Other transnational club competitions include the [[Pro14]] in Europe and South Africa, the [[European Rugby Champions Cup]] solely in Europe, and [[Super Rugby]], in the Southern Hemisphere and Japan.

{{wikisource|Laws of Football as played at Rugby_School}}

The origin of rugby football is reputed to be an incident during a game of [[English public school football games|English school football]] at Rugby School in 1823, when [[William Webb Ellis]] is said to have picked up the ball and run with it.<ref>{{cite web|title = Webb Ellis, William|url = http://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/webb-ellis.html|accessdate =14 September 2009}}</ref> Although the evidence for the story is doubtful, it was immortalised at the school with a [[commemorative plaque|plaque]] unveiled in 1895.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Flotsam|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/qi/episodes/6/3/|series=QI|serieslink=QI|network=[[BBC]]|station=BBC One |location=UK|airdate=9 January 2009|seriesno=F|number=3}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title = William Webb Ellis&nbsp;– fact or fiction?|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/low/rugby_union/6255164.stm |first=Sean|last=Davies|publisher=BBC  |accessdate =20 September 2011|date=10 August 2007}}</ref> Despite the doubtful evidence, the [[Webb Ellis Cup|Rugby World Cup trophy]] is named after Webb Ellis. Rugby football stems from the [[English public school football games|form of game]] played at Rugby School, which former pupils then introduced to their university.

Old Rugbeian [[Albert Pell]], a student at [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]], is credited with having formed the first "football" team.<ref name="Marshall13">{{Harvnb|Marshall|Jordon|1951|p=13}}</ref> During this early period different schools used different rules, with former pupils from Rugby and [[Eton College|Eton]] attempting to carry their preferred rules through to their universities.<ref name="Marshall13-14">{{Harvnb|Marshall|Jordon|1951|pp=13–14}}</ref>

A significant event in the early development of rugby football was the production of the first written laws of the game at Rugby School in 1845,<ref>{{Harvnb|Godwin|Rhys|1981|p=9}}</ref><ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-coventry-warwickshire-25946757 "Six ways the town of Rugby helped change the world"].

===First internationals===
The [[1871 England versus Scotland rugby union match|first rugby football international]] was played on 27 March 1871 between [[Scottish Rugby Union|Scotland]] and [[England national rugby union team|England]] in [[Edinburgh]]. Scotland won the game 1-0.<ref name="Godwin10"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/timeline1870s.htm|title=Historical Rugby Milestones 1870s|publisher=Rugby Football History|accessdate=22 March 2015}}</ref> By 1881 both Ireland and Wales had representative teams, and in 1883 the first international competition, the [[Six Nations Championship|Home Nations Championship]] had begun. 1883 is also the year of the first [[rugby sevens]] tournament, the [[Melrose Sevens]],<ref name="Godwin12">{{Harvnb|Godwin|Rhys|1981|p=12}}</ref> which is still held annually.

Two important overseas tours took place in 1888: a [[1888 British Lions tour to New Zealand and Australia|British Isles]] team visited Australia and New Zealand—although a private venture, it laid the foundations for future [[British and Irish Lions]] tours;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lionsrugby.com/history/5023.php |title=1888 Australia & New Zealand |publisher=The British and irish Lions |accessdate=13 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607033526/http://www.lionsrugby.com/history/5023.php |archivedate=7 June 2011 }}</ref> and the [[1888–89 New Zealand Native football team]] brought the first overseas team to British spectators.<ref>{{cite book |title=Forerunners of the All Blacks |last=Ryan |first=Greg |publisher=Canterbury University Press |year=1993 |location=Christchurch, New Zealand|isbn=0-908812-30-2|page=44}}</ref>

During the early history of rugby union, a time before commercial air travel, teams from different continents rarely met. The first two notable tours both took place in 1888{{mdash}}the British Isles team touring New Zealand and Australia,<ref name="Lions history">{{cite news|url=http://www.lionsrugby.com/history/potted_history.php |title=The History |publisher=lionsrugby.com |accessdate=24 September 2011}}</ref> followed by the New Zealand team touring Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irb.com/history/halloffame/newsid=2027752.html |title=IRB Hall of Fame Welcomes Five Inductees |publisher=International Rugby Board |date=23 November 2008 |accessdate=24 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100824065112/http://www.irb.com/history/halloffame/newsid=2027752.html |archivedate=24 August 2010 }}</ref> Traditionally the most prestigious tours were the Southern Hemisphere countries of Australia, New Zealand and South Africa making a tour of a Northern Hemisphere, and the return tours made by a joint British and Irish team.<ref>{{Harvnb|Griffiths|1987|p=ix}} ''"In the first century of rugby union's history the IRB only recognised matches with international status if both teams in a match came from a small pool of countries: Australia, British Lions, England, France, Ireland, New Zealand, Scotland, South Africa and Wales."''</ref> Tours would last for months, due to long traveling times and the number of games undertaken; the 1888 New Zealand team began their tour in Hawkes Bay in June and did not complete their schedule until August 1889, having played 107 rugby matches.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/culture/the-new-zealand-natives-rugby-tour/nz-natives-rugby-tour |title=New Zealand Natives' rugby tour of 1888–9 |publisher=New Zealand History Online |accessdate=24 September 2011}}</ref>  Touring international sides would play Test matches against international opponents, including national, club and county sides in the case of Northern Hemisphere rugby, or provincial/state sides in the case of Southern Hemisphere rugby.<ref name="Lions history"/><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.espnscrum.com/scrum/rugby/page/78377.html |title=Take a trip down memory lane courtesy of our historian John Griffiths |publisher=espnscrum.com |date=23 November 2008 |accessdate=6 October 2011}} ''"1 October: The original Wallabies beat a strong Gloucestershire XV 16–0 at Kingsholm, 2 October: The Invincible Second All Blacks have their toughest tour assignment when they are considered lucky to scrape home 13–10 against a star-studded Newport XV, 2 October: Argentina serve notice of their rapidly rising rugby stock by beating a Cardiff side captained by Gerald Davies."''</ref>

Between 1905 and 1908, all three major Southern Hemisphere rugby countries sent their first touring teams to the Northern Hemisphere: [[The Original All Blacks|New Zealand]] in 1905, followed by [[1906-07 South Africa rugby union tour|South Africa]] in 1906 and [[1908-09 Australia rugby union tour of Britain|Australia]] in 1908. All three teams brought new styles of play, fitness levels and tactics,<ref name="Godwin, p18">{{Harvnb|Godwin|Rhys|1981|p=18}}</ref> and were far more successful than critics had expected.<ref>{{Harvnb|Thomas|Rowe|1954|p=27}} ''"When they arrived in this country [Britain] they were regarded as an unknown quantity, but it was not anticipated that they would give the stronger British teams a great deal of opposition. The result of the very first match against Devon was regarded as a foregone conclusion by most British followers."''</ref>

The New Zealand 1905 touring team performed a [[Ka Mate|haka]] before each match, leading Welsh Rugby Union administrator [[Tom Williams (rugby player, born 1860)|Tom Williams]] to suggest that Wales player [[Teddy Morgan]] lead the crowd in singing the Welsh National Anthem, ''[[Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau]]'', as a response. After Morgan began singing, the crowd joined in: the first time a national anthem was sung at the start of a sporting event.<ref>{{cite web|title=The anthem in more recent years|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/music/sites/anthem/pages/anthem-today.shtml|accessdate=3 December 2010 |publisher=[[BBC Cymru Wales]]|date=1 December 2008 |work=[[BBC Cymru Wales|BBC Cymru Wales history]]}}</ref>{{refn|group=nb|Although the United States national anthem, "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]", was first sung before baseball games in the mid-19th century, it did not become the official national anthem until 1931.

Rugby union was included as an event in the Olympic Games four times during the early 20th century. No international rugby games and union-sponsored club matches were played during the First World War, but competitions continued through service teams such as the [[New Zealand Army rugby team of 1919|New Zealand Army team]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Godwin|Rhys|1981|p=19}}</ref> During the Second World War no international matches were played by most countries, though Italy, Germany and Romania played a limited number of games,<ref>[http://www.scrum.com/italy/rugby/match/19590.html Italy tour&nbsp;– Bucharest, 14 April 1940] Romania vs Italy, Scrum.com</ref><ref>[http://www.scrum.com/italy/rugby/match/19591.html Italy tour&nbsp;– Stuttgart, 5 May 1940] Germany vs Italy, Scrum.com</ref><ref>[http://www.scrum.com/italy/rugby/match/19592.html Romania tour&nbsp;– Milan, 2 May 1942] Italy vs Romania, Scrum.com</ref> and [[Cambridge University R.U.F.C.|Cambridge]] and [[Oxford University RFC|Oxford]] continued their annual [[The Varsity Match|University Match]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Godwin|Rhys|1981|p=22}}</ref>

The first officially sanctioned international rugby sevens tournament took place in 1973 at Murrayfield, one of Scotland's biggest stadiums, as part of the [[Scottish Rugby Union]] centenary celebrations.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rugby in the Olympics: Future |url=http://www.irb.com/rugbyandtheolympics/future.html |work=[[International Rugby Board|IRB]] |accessdate=18 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810065813/http://www.irb.com/rugbyandtheolympics/future.html |archivedate=10 August 2011 }}</ref>

===World Cup and professionalism===
In 1987 the first Rugby World Cup was held in Australia and New Zealand, and the inaugural winners were New Zealand. The first World Cup Sevens tournament was held at Murrayfield in 1993. Rugby Sevens was introduced into the [[Commonwealth Rugby Sevens Championships|Commonwealth Games]] in 1998 and was added to the Olympic Games of 2016.<ref name="I.O.C. Decision"/>

Rugby union was an amateur sport until the IRB declared the game "open" in August 1995 (shortly after the completion of the 1995 World Cup), removing restrictions on payments to players.<ref name=Stubbs3>{{Harvnb|Stubbs|2009|p=118}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=History of the RFU |url=http://www.rfu.com/AboutTheRFU/History.aspx |work=[[Rugby Football Union|RFU]] |accessdate=28 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100422210444/http://www.rfu.com/AboutTheRFU/History.aspx |archivedate=22 April 2010 }}</ref> However, the pre-1995 period of rugby union was marked by frequent accusations of "[[shamateurism]]",<ref>{{cite news|title = Ontario: The Shamateurs|url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,804253,00.html|work=TIME |date=29 September 1947|accessdate =6 February 2010}}</ref> including an investigation in Britain by a House of Commons Select committee in early 1995.<ref>{{cite news

===Forwards===
The main responsibilities of the forward players are to gain and retain possession of the ball.<ref name="talkrugby">{{cite web|url=http://www.talkrugbyunion.co.uk/guides/rugby_union_positions.html |title=Rugby Union Positions |publisher=talkrugbyunion.co.uk |accessdate=13 August 2011}}</ref> Players in these positions are generally bigger and stronger and take part in the scrum and line-out.<ref name="talkrugby"/> The forwards are often collectively referred to as the 'pack', especially when in the scrum formation.<ref name="Glossary">{{cite web|url=http://www.espnscrum.com/scrum/rugby/page/97263.html|work=ESPN Scrum.com |title=Rugby Glossary |accessdate=13 August 2011}}</ref>

'''Front row'''<br />
The front row consists of three players: two props (the loosehead prop and the tighthead prop) and the hooker. The role of the two props is to support the hooker during scrums, to provide support for the jumpers during line-outs and to provide strength and power in rucks and mauls. The third position in the front row is the hooker. The hooker is a key position in attacking and defensive play and is responsible for winning the ball in the scrum. Hookers normally throw the ball in at line-outs.<ref name="IRB BGRU 6"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://rugbycoaching.net/rugby-coaching/rugby-positions-explained/|title=Rugby Positions Explained|publisher=Rugby Coaching|accessdate=30 September 2012}}</ref>

'''Second row'''<br />
The second row consists of two locks or lock forwards. Locks are usually the tallest players in the team, and specialize as line-out jumpers.<ref name="IRB BGRU 6"/> The main role of the lock in line-outs is to make a standing jump, often supported by the other forwards, to either collect the thrown ball or ensure the ball comes down on their side. Locks also have an important role in the scrum, binding directly behind the three front row players and providing forward drive.<ref name="IRB BGRU 6"/>
[[File:Chabal Rugby Racing vs Stade Toulousain 311009.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sébastien Chabal]] (far left) in number eight position before entering the scrum.|alt=Facing right a group of seven men, in blue and white hooped jersey, bind together and crouch to form a scrum, the eighth player stands behind them observing the off-picture opposition.]]
'''Back row'''<br />
The back row, not to be confused with ‘Backs’, is the third and final row of the forward positions, they are often referred to as the loose forwards.<ref name="Glossary"/> The three positions in the back row are the two flankers and the number 8. The two flanker positions called the blindside flanker and openside flanker, are the final row in the scrum. They are usually the most mobile forwards in the game. Their main role is to win possession through 'turn overs'.<ref name="IRB BGRU 6"/> The number 8 packs down between the two locks at the back of the scrum. The role of the number 8 in the scrum is to control the ball after it has been heeled back from the front of the pack and the position provides a link between the forwards and backs during attacking phases.<ref name="IRB BGRU 7">{{cite web|url=https://passport.worldrugby.org/beginners_guide/downloads/Beginners_Guide_2015_EN.pdf|work=[[World Rugby]] |title=A Beginner's Guide to Rugby Union |page=7|accessdate=28 September 2015}}</ref>

===Backs===
The backs' role is to create and convert point-scoring opportunities. They are generally smaller, faster and more agile than the forwards.<ref name="talkrugby"/> Another distinction between the backs and the forwards is that the backs are expected to have superior kicking and ball-handling skills, especially the fly-half, scrum-half, and full-back.<ref name="talkrugby"/>

'''Half-backs'''<br />
The half-backs consist of two positions, the scrum-half and the fly-half. The fly-half is crucial to a team's game plan, orchestrating the team's performance.<ref name="IRB BGRU 7"/> They are usually the first to receive the ball from the scrum-half following a breakdown, lineout, or scrum, and need to be decisive with what actions to take and be effective at communicating with the outside backs.<ref name="IRB BGRU 7"/> Many fly-halves are also their team's goal kickers. The scrum-half is the link between the forwards and the backs.<ref name="IRB BGRU 7"/> They receive the ball from the lineout and remove the ball from the back of the scrum, usually passing it to the fly-half.<ref name="IRB BGRU 8">{{cite web|url=https://passport.worldrugby.org/beginners_guide/downloads/Beginners_Guide_2015_EN.pdf|work=[[World Rugby]] |title=A Beginner's Guide to Rugby Union |page=8|accessdate=28 September 2015}}</ref> They also feed the scrum and sometimes have to act as a fourth loose forward.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bompa|Claro|2008|p=62}}</ref>

'''Three quarters'''<br />
There are four three quarter positions, the inside centre, outside centre and left and right wings. The centres will attempt to tackle attacking players; whilst in attack, they should employ speed and strength to breach opposition defences.<ref name="IRB BGRU 7"/> The wings are generally positioned on the outside of the backline. Their primary function is to finish off moves and score tries.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brown, Guthrie and Growden|(2010)}}</ref> Wings are usually the fastest players in the team and are elusive runners who use their speed to avoid tackles.<ref>{{cite news|title=Scottish rugby welcomes back Lomu|date=7 January 2006|first=David|last=Ferguson |url=http://sport.scotsman.com/superteams/Scottish-rugby-welcomes-back-Lomu.2740238.jp|newspaper=Scotsman|accessdate=1 September 2011}}</ref>

'''Fullback'''<br />
The fullback normally position themselves several metres behind the back line. They often field opposition kicks and are usually the last line of defence should an opponent break through the back line.<ref name="IRB BGRU 7"/> Two of the most important attributes of a good fullback are dependable catching skills and a good kicking game.<ref name = "MacDonald">{{cite book|title=Rugger Practice and Tactics&nbsp;– A Manual of Rugby Football Technique |first=H.

===Scoring===
Rugby union is played between two teams&nbsp;– the one that scores more points wins the game. Points can be scored in several ways: a [[try]], scored by grounding the ball in the in-goal area (between the goal line and the dead-ball line), is worth 5 points and a subsequent conversion kick scores 2 points; a successful penalty kick or a [[drop goal]] each score 3 points.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://laws.worldrugby.org/downloads/World_Rugby_Laws_2015_EN.pdf |work=[[World Rugby]] |title=Law 9 Method of Scoring |format=PDF |accessdate=28 September 2015 |pages=62–65 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216025124/http://laws.worldrugby.org/downloads/World_Rugby_Laws_2015_EN.pdf |archivedate=16 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The values of each of these scoring methods have been changed over the years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/scoring.htm |title=Scoring through the ages |work=rugbyfootballhistory.com  |accessdate=16 August 2011}}</ref>

===Playing field===
The field of play on a rugby pitch is as near as possible to a maximum of {{convert|144|m|yd}} long by {{convert|70|m|yd}} wide.<ref name="pitch size">{{cite web |url=http://laws.worldrugby.org/downloads/World_Rugby_Laws_2015_EN.pdf |title=Law 1: The Ground |pages=25–30 |work=[[World Rugby]] |format=PDF |accessdate=28 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216025124/http://laws.worldrugby.org/downloads/World_Rugby_Laws_2015_EN.pdf |archivedate=16 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In actual gameplay there should be a maximum of {{convert|100|m|yd|0}} between the two try-lines, with anywhere between 10 and 22 metres behind each try line to serve as the in-goal area.<ref name="pitch size"/> Several lines cross the field, notably the halfway line and the "twenty-two", which is {{convert|22|m|yd|0}} from the goal line.<ref name="pitch size"/>

Stricter rules apply to the pitch size for matches between national representative teams. The same maximums apply in this case, but the distance between the two try-lines must also be at least {{convert|94|m|yd}} and the pitch must be at least {{convert|68|m|yd}} wide.<ref name="pitch size"/>

Rugby goalposts are H-shaped, and consist of two poles, {{convert|5.6|m|yd}} apart, connected by a horizontal crossbar {{convert|3|m|yd}} above the ground.<ref name="pitch size"/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/rugby_union/six_nations/618637.stm |title=A beginner's guide to ... rugby laws |work=BBC |date=31 January 2000 |accessdate=24 September 2011}}</ref>

===Match structure===
At the beginning of the game, the captains and the referee toss a coin to decide which team will kick off first. Play then starts with a dropkick, with the players chasing the ball into the opposition's territory, and the other side trying to retrieve the ball and advance it. If the ball does not reach the opponent's 10-metre line the opposing team has two choices: to have the ball kicked off again, or to have a [[scrum (rugby union)|scrum]] at the centre of the half-way line.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://laws.worldrugby.org/downloads/World_Rugby_Laws_2015_EN.pdf |format=PDF |work=[[World Rugby]] |pages=85–91 |title=Law 13 Kick-off and Restart Kicks |accessdate=28 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216025124/http://laws.worldrugby.org/downloads/World_Rugby_Laws_2015_EN.pdf |archivedate=16 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>
If the player with the ball is tackled, frequently a [[Playing rugby union#Ruck|ruck]] will result.<ref name=Midgley>{{Cite book| last = Midgley| first = Ruth| title = The Official World Encyclopedia of Sports and Games| publisher=Diagram Group| year = 1979| location = London| url =|page=394 | isbn = 0-7092-0153-2}}</ref>

Games are divided into 40-minute halves, with a [[Half-time|break]] in the middle.<ref name="IRBLaw5">{{cite web |url=http://laws.worldrugby.org/downloads/World_Rugby_Laws_2015_EN.pdf |title=Law 5: Time |work=[[World Rugby]] |pages=45–47 |format=PDF |accessdate=27 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216025124/http://laws.worldrugby.org/downloads/World_Rugby_Laws_2015_EN.pdf |archivedate=16 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The sides exchange ends of the field after the half-time break.<ref name="IRBLaw5"/> Stoppages for injury or to allow the referee to take disciplinary action do not count as part of the playing time, so that the elapsed time is usually longer than 80 minutes.<ref name="IRBLaw5"/> The referee is responsible for keeping time, even when—as in many professional tournaments—he is assisted by an official time-keeper.<ref name="IRBLaw5"/> If time expires while the ball is in play, the game continues until the ball is "dead", and only then will the referee blow the whistle to signal half-time or full-time; but if the referee awards a penalty or free-kick, the game continues.<ref name="IRBLaw5"/>

In the knockout stages of rugby competitions, most notably the [[Rugby World Cup]], two extra time periods of 10 minutes periods are played (with an interval of 5 minutes in between) if the game is tied after full-time. If scores are level after 100 minutes then the rules call for 20 minutes of sudden-death extra time to be played. If the sudden-death extra time period results in no scoring a kicking competition is used to determine the winner. However, no match in the history of the Rugby World Cup has ever gone past 100 minutes into a sudden-death extra time period.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irb.com/jwrt/rules/index.html |title=IRB Laws&nbsp;– Time |date=7 December 2013 |accessdate=7 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080325160709/http://www.irb.com/jwrt/rules/index.html |archivedate=25 March 2008 }}</ref>

Forward passing (throwing the ball ahead to another player) is not allowed; the ball can be passed laterally or backwards.<ref name="irblaws12">{{cite web |url=http://laws.worldrugby.org/downloads/World_Rugby_Laws_2015_EN.pdf |title=Law 12 Knock-on or Throw Forward |publisher=[[World Rugby]] |accessdate=28 September 2015 |pages=81–83 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216025124/http://laws.worldrugby.org/downloads/World_Rugby_Laws_2015_EN.pdf |archivedate=16 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The ball tends to be moved forward in three ways&nbsp;— by kicking, by a player running with it or within a scrum or [[Playing rugby union#Maul|maul]].

When a player anywhere in the playing area kicks indirectly into [[Touch (rugby)|touch]] so that the ball first bounces in the field of play, the throw-in is taken where the ball went into touch.<ref name="WRlaw19">{{cite web |url=http://laws.worldrugby.org/downloads/World_Rugby_Laws_2015_EN.pdf |title=Law 19 Touch and Lineout |publisher=[[World Rugby]] |accessdate=28 September 2015 |pages=117–137 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216025124/http://laws.worldrugby.org/downloads/World_Rugby_Laws_2015_EN.pdf |archivedate=16 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> If the player kicks directly into touch (i.e. without bouncing in-field first) from within one's own 22-metre line, the lineout is taken by the opposition where the ball went into touch, but if the ball is kicked into touch directly by a player outside the 22-metre line, the lineout is taken level to where the kick was taken.<ref name="WRlaw19"/>

===Breakdowns===
[[File:Schoolkids doing a rugby tackle.jpg|thumb|right|180px|A rugby tackle: tackles must be below the neck with the aim of impeding or grounding the player with the ball|alt=A child running away from camera in green and black hooped rugby jersey is in the process of being tackled around the hips and legs by an opponent]]
The aim of the defending side is to stop the player with the ball, either by bringing them to ground (a tackle, which is frequently followed by a ruck) or by contesting for possession with the ball-carrier on their feet (a maul). Such a circumstance is called a breakdown and each is governed by a specific law.

'''Tackling'''

A player may tackle an opposing player who has the ball by holding them while bringing them to ground. Tacklers cannot tackle above the shoulder (the neck and head are out of bounds),<ref name="10.4e">{{cite web |url=http://www.irblaws.com/index.php?law=10 |title=Law 10 Foul play |page=10.4(e) |publisher=[[International Rugby Board|IRB]] |accessdate=26 April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022230153/http://www.irblaws.com/index.php?law=10 |archive-date=22 October 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and the tackler has to attempt to wrap their arms around the player being tackled to complete the tackle. It is illegal to push, shoulder-charge, or to trip a player using feet or legs, but hands may be used (this being referred to as a tap-tackle or [[Ankle tap|ankle-tap]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.irblaws.com/index.php?law=10 |title=Law 10 Foul play |page=10.4(d) |publisher=[[International Rugby Board|IRB]] |accessdate=27 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209111927/http://www.irblaws.com/index.php?law=10 |archive-date=9 February 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.irblaws.com/index.php?law=10 |title=Law 10 Foul play |page=10.4(g) |publisher=[[International Rugby Board|IRB]] |accessdate=27 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209111927/http://www.irblaws.com/index.php?law=10 |archive-date=9 February 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Tacklers may not tackle an opponent who has jumped to catch a ball until the player has landed.<ref name="10.4e"/>

'''Rucking and Mauling'''

Mauls occur after a player with the ball has come into contact with an opponent but the handler remains on his feet; once any combination of at least three players have bound themselves a maul has been set.<ref name="Glossary"/> A ruck is similar to the maul, but in this case the ball has gone to ground with at least three attacking players binding themselves on the ground in an attempt to secure the ball.<ref name="Glossary"/>

===Set pieces===

====Lineout====

When the ball leaves the side of the field, a [[line-out (rugby union)|line-out]] is awarded against the team which last touched the ball.<ref name="irblaws19">{{cite web |url=http://www.irblaws.com/index.php?law=19 |title=Law 19 Touch and Lineout |publisher=[[International Rugby Board|IRB]] |accessdate=27 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209104345/http://www.irblaws.com/index.php?law=19 |archive-date=9 February 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Forward players from each team line up a metre apart, perpendicular to the touchline and between 5 m and 15 m from the touchline.<ref name="irblaws19"/> The ball is thrown from the touchline down the centre of the lines of forwards by a player (usually the [[hooker (rugby union)|hooker]]) from the team that did not play the ball into touch.<ref name="irblaws19"/> The exception to this is when the ball went out from a penalty, in which case the side who gained the penalty throws the ball in.<ref name="irblaws19"/>

A team may also opt for a scrum if awarded a penalty.<ref name="WRlaw20"/>

A scrum is formed by the eight forwards from each team binding together in three rows.<ref name="WRlaw20"/> The front row consists of the two props (loosehead and tighthead) either side of the hooker.<ref name="WRlaw20"/> The second row consists of two locks and the two flankers.

Common offences include tackling above the shoulders, collapsing a [[Scrum (rugby union)|scrum]], ruck or maul, not releasing the ball when on the ground, or being offside.<ref name="WRLaw10">{{cite web |url=http://laws.worldrugby.org/downloads/World_Rugby_Laws_2015_EN.pdf |title=Law 10: Foul Play |work=[[World Rugby]] |format=PDF |pages=66–74 |accessdate=28 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216025124/http://laws.worldrugby.org/downloads/World_Rugby_Laws_2015_EN.pdf |archivedate=16 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The non-offending team has a number of options when awarded a penalty: a "tap" kick, when the ball is kicked a very short distance from hand, allowing the kicker to regather the ball and run with it; a punt, when the ball is kicked a long distance from hand, for field position; a place-kick, when the kicker will attempt to score a goal; or a scrum.<ref name="WRLaw10"/> Players may be sent off (signalled by a [[Red card (sports)|red card]]) or temporarily suspended ("sin-binned") for ten minutes ([[Yellow card (sport)|yellow card]]) for foul play or repeated infringements, and may not be replaced.<ref name="WRLaw10"/>

Occasionally, infringements are not caught by the referee during the match and these may be "cited" by the [[citing commissioner]] after the match and have punishments (usually suspension for a number of weeks) imposed on the infringing player.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ercrugby.com/eng/heinekencup/rules/index.php |title=European Club Rugby: Key Tournament Rules |work=ercrugby.com |accessdate=24 October 2011}}</ref>

===Replacements and substitutions===
During the match, players may be replaced (for injury) or substituted (for tactical reasons).<ref name="Law3"/> A player who has been replaced may not rejoin play unless he was temporarily replaced to have bleeding controlled; a player who has been substituted may return temporarily, to replace a player who has a blood injury or has suffered a concussion, or permanently, if he is replacing a front-row forward.<ref name="Law3"/> In international matches, eight replacements are allowed; in domestic or cross-border tournaments, at the discretion of the responsible national union(s), the number of replacements may be nominated to a maximum of eight, of whom three must be sufficiently trained and experienced to provide cover for the three front row positions.<ref name="Law3"/><ref name="Uncontested">{{cite web|url=http://www.irb.com/newsmedia/mediazone/pressrelease/newsid=2033086.html#irb+acts+uncontested+scrums |title=IRB acts on uncontested scrums |publisher=[[World Rugby|International Rugby Board]] |date=19 August 2009 |accessdate=23 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822203000/http://www.irb.com/newsmedia/mediazone/pressrelease/newsid=2033086.html |archivedate=22 August 2009 }}</ref>

Prior to 2016, all substitutions, no matter the cause, counted against the limit during a match. In 2016, [[World Rugby]] changed the law so that substitutions made to replace a player deemed unable to continue due to foul play by the opposition would no longer count against the match limit. This change was introduced in January of that year in the Southern Hemisphere and June in the Northern Hemisphere.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/rugby/story/_/id/15885158/world-rugby-introduces-new-rules-stop-simulation |title=World Rugby introduces new rules to stop simulation |publisher=[[ESPN (UK)]] |date=1 June 2016 |accessdate=4 June 2016}}</ref>

Although the exact date of arrival of [[rugby union in Trinidad and Tobago]] is unknown, their first club Northern RFC was formed in 1923, a national team was playing by 1927 and due to a cancelled tour to [[British Guiana]] in 1933, switched their venue to [[Rugby union in Barbados|Barbados]]; introducing rugby to the island.<ref>{{Harvnb|Godwin|Rhys|1981|p=160}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Godwin|Rhys|1981|p=43}}</ref> Other Atlantic countries to play rugby union include [[Rugby union in Jamaica|Jamaica]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irb.com/unions/union=11000064/index.html |title=Jamaica |work=[[World Rugby|IRB]] |accessdate=6 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928002800/http://www.irb.com/unions/union=11000064/index.html |archivedate=28 September 2011 }}</ref> and [[Rugby union in Bermuda|Bermuda]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irb.com/unions/union=11000040/index.html |title=Bermuda |work=[[World Rugby|IRB]] |accessdate=6 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110915192248/http://www.irb.com/unions/union=11000040/index.html |archivedate=15 September 2011 }}</ref>

===Europe===
[[File:Germany vs Belgium rugby match.jpg|thumb|Germany playing [[Belgium national rugby union team|Belgium]]]]
The growth of rugby union in Europe outside the 6 Nations countries in terms of playing numbers has been sporadic. Historically, British and Irish home teams played the Southern Hemisphere teams of Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, as well as France. The rest of Europe were let to play amongst themselves. During a period when it had been isolated by the British and Irish Unions, France, lacking international competition, became the only European team from the top tier to regularly play the other European countries; mainly [[Rugby union in Belgium|Belgium]], the [[Rugby union in the Netherlands|Netherlands]], [[Rugby union in Germany|Germany]], [[Rugby union in Spain|Spain]], [[Rugby union in Romania|Romania]], [[Rugby union in Poland|Poland]], [[Rugby union in Italy|Italy]] and [[Rugby union in Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia]].<ref name="FIRA"/><ref>{{cite book |last=Dine |first=Philip |title=French Rugby Football |year=2001 |pages=79–94|publisher=Berg |location=Oxford |isbn=1-85973-327-1}}</ref> In 1934, instigated by the [[French Rugby Federation]], FIRA (Fédération Internationale de Rugby Amateur) was formed to organise rugby union outside the authority of the IRFB.<ref name="FIRA"/> The founding members were {{runion|ITA}}, {{runion|ROM}}, {{runion|NLD}}, {{runion|POR}}, {{runion|CSK}}, and {{runion|SWE}}.

Other European rugby playing nations of note include [[Rugby union in Russia|Russia]], whose first officially recorded match is marked by an encounter between Dynamo Moscow and the Moscow Institute of Physical Education in 1933.<ref>{{Harvnb|Godwin|Rhys|1981|p=148}}</ref> [[Rugby union in Portugal]] also took hold between the First and Second World Wars, with a Portuguese National XV set up in 1922 and an official championship started in 1927.<ref>{{Harvnb|Godwin|Rhys|1981|p=130}}</ref>

In 1999, FIRA agreed to place itself under the auspices of the IRB, transforming itself into a strictly European organising body. Accordingly, it changed its name to FIRA–AER (Fédération Internationale de Rugby Amateur – Association Européenne de Rugby). It adopted its current name of [[Rugby Europe]] in 2014.

===South America===

===Asia===
{{main|Rugby union in Asia}}
Many Asian countries have a tradition of playing rugby dating from the British Empire. [[Rugby union in India|India]] began playing rugby in the early 1870s, the [[Calcutta Football Club]] forming in 1873. However, with the departure of a local British army regiment, interest in rugby diminished in the area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofBritain/The-Calcutta-Cup/|title=The History of the Calcutta Cup|publisher=}}</ref> In 1878, The Calcutta Football Club was disbanded, and rugby in India faltered.<ref>{{Harvnb|Godwin|Rhys|1981|p=92}}</ref> [[Rugby union in Sri Lanka|Sri Lanka]] claims to have founded their union in 1878, and although little official information from the period is available, the team won the All-India cup in Madras in 1920.<ref>{{Harvnb|Godwin|Rhys|1981|p=152}}</ref> The first recorded match in [[Rugby union in Malaysia|Malaysia]] was in 1892, but the first confirmation of rugby is the existence of the ''HMS Malaya Cup'' which was first presented in 1922 and is still awarded to the winners of the Malay sevens.<ref>{{Harvnb|Godwin|Rhys|1981|pp=112–113}}</ref>

Rugby in the Middle East and the Gulf States has its history in the 1950s, with clubs formed by British and French Services stationed in the region after the Second World War.<ref>{{Harvnb|Godwin|Rhys|1981|p=42}}</ref> When these servicemen left, the clubs and teams were kept alive by young professionals, mostly Europeans, working in these countries.

===Africa===
In 1875, rugby was introduced to [[Rugby union in South Africa|South Africa]] by British soldiers garrisoned in Cape Town.<ref name="Godwin11"/> During the late 19th and early 20th century, the sport in Africa was spread by settlers and colonials who often adopted a "whites-only" policy to playing the game.

The Rugby Championship is the Southern Hemisphere's annual international series for that region's top national teams.

==Variants==
{{main|Rugby sevens}}
[[File:Spielszene BK.jpg|thumb|[[Beach rugby]] match|alt=On a sunlit beach two teams of players, one in yellow the other in blue, play a form of rugby; the central yellow player runs forward clutching the ball with one hand, close to his chest.]]

The game of rugby union has spawned several variants of the full-contact, 15-a-side code. The two more common differences applied to the variants of the sport lie in either fewer players or reduced player contact. Of the variants, the oldest is [[Rugby sevens]] (7s, or VIIs), a fast-paced variant which originated in [[Melrose, Scotland|Melrose]], Scotland in 1883. In rugby sevens, there are only seven players per side, and each half is normally seven minutes.

Major tournaments include the [[Hong Kong Sevens]] and [[Dubai Sevens]], both held in areas not normally associated with the highest levels of the 15-a-side game.

[[File:Tom Wills 1857.jpg|thumb|When codifying [[Australian rules football]] in 1859, [[Tom Wills]] drew inspiration from an early version of rugby he learnt at Rugby School.]]
[[Rugby league]] was formed as an administrative break from the English union before changing its laws, becoming a code in its own right. The two sports continue to influence each other to this day.

'''Rugby union''', commonly known in most of the world simply as '''rugby''',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.worldrugby.org/welcome-to-rugby/what-is-rugby|title=What is Rugby?|publisher=World Rugby|accessdate=28 March 2018}}</ref> is a [[Contact sport#Terminology|contact]] [[team sport]] which originated in [[England]] in the first half of the 19th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/originsofrugby.htm#2 |title=Origins of Rugby&nbsp;– Codification "The innovation of running with the ball was introduced some time between 1820 and 1830." |publisher=Rugbyfootballhistory.com |accessdate=15 August 2011}}</ref> One of the [[Comparison of rugby league and rugby union|two codes]] of [[rugby football]], it is based on running with the ball in hand.  In its most common form, a game is between two teams of 15 players using an oval-shaped [[rugby ball|ball]] on a rectangular field with H-shaped goalposts at each end.

Rugby union is a popular sport around the world, played by male and female players of all ages. In 2014, there were more than 6 million people playing worldwide, of whom 2.36 million were registered players. [[World Rugby]], previously called the International Rugby Football Board (IRFB) and the International Rugby Board (IRB), has been the governing body for rugby union since 1886, and currently has 101 countries as full members and 18 associate members.

In 1845, the first football laws were written by [[Rugby School]] pupils; other significant events in the early development of rugby include the [[Blackheath F.C.|Blackheath Club]]'s decision to leave [[the Football Association]] in 1863 and the [[History of rugby league|split]] between rugby union and [[rugby league]] in 1895.  Historically an amateur sport, in 1995 restrictions on payments to players were removed, making the game openly professional at the highest level for the first time.<ref>{{cite news|last=Scianitti|first=Matthew|title=The world awaits for Canada's rugby team|url=http://sports.nationalpost.com/2011/06/18/the-world-awaits-for-canadas-rugby-team/|accessdate=22 March 2015|newspaper=[[National Post]]|date=18 June 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130129194424/http://sports.nationalpost.com/2011/06/18/the-world-awaits-for-canadas-rugby-team/|archivedate=29 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Rugby union spread from the [[Home Nations]] of Great Britain and Ireland and was absorbed by many of the countries associated with the [[British Empire]]. Early exponents of the sport included Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and France. Countries that have adopted rugby union as their ''de facto'' [[national sport]] include Fiji, Georgia, Madagascar,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.irb.com/newsmedia/regional/newsid=53025.html |accessdate=1 December 2013 |title=Madagascar take Sevens honours |date=23 August 2007 |publisher=International Rugby Board |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AGpxxkZd?url=http://www.irb.com/newsmedia/regional/newsid=53025.html |archivedate=29 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref> New Zealand, Samoa and Tonga.

International matches have taken place since 1871 when the first game took place between Scotland and England at Raeburn Place in Edinburgh. The [[Rugby World Cup]], first held in 1987, takes place every four years. The [[Six Nations Championship]] in Europe and [[The Rugby Championship]] in the Southern Hemisphere are other major international competitions, held annually.

National club or provincial competitions include the [[Premiership Rugby|Premiership]] in England, the [[Top 14]] in France, the [[Mitre 10 Cup]] in New Zealand, the [[National Rugby Championship]] in Australia, and the [[Currie Cup]] in South Africa. Other transnational club competitions include the [[Pro14]] in Europe and South Africa, the [[European Rugby Champions Cup]] solely in Europe, and [[Super Rugby]], in the Southern Hemisphere and Japan.

{{wikisource|Laws of Football as played at Rugby_School}}

The origin of rugby football is reputed to be an incident during a game of [[English public school football games|English school football]] at Rugby School in 1823, when [[William Webb Ellis]] is said to have picked up the ball and run with it.<ref>{{cite web|title = Webb Ellis, William|url = http://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/webb-ellis.html|accessdate =14 September 2009}}</ref> Although the evidence for the story is doubtful, it was immortalised at the school with a [[commemorative plaque|plaque]] unveiled in 1895.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Flotsam|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/qi/episodes/6/3/|series=QI|serieslink=QI|network=[[BBC]]|station=BBC One |location=UK|airdate=9 January 2009|seriesno=F|number=3}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title = William Webb Ellis&nbsp;– fact or fiction?|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/low/rugby_union/6255164.stm |first=Sean|last=Davies|publisher=BBC  |accessdate =20 September 2011|date=10 August 2007}}</ref> Despite the doubtful evidence, the [[Webb Ellis Cup|Rugby World Cup trophy]] is named after Webb Ellis. Rugby football stems from the [[English public school football games|form of game]] played at Rugby School, which former pupils then introduced to their university.

Old Rugbeian [[Albert Pell]], a student at [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]], is credited with having formed the first "football" team.<ref name="Marshall13">{{Harvnb|Marshall|Jordon|1951|p=13}}</ref> During this early period different schools used different rules, with former pupils from Rugby and [[Eton College|Eton]] attempting to carry their preferred rules through to their universities.<ref name="Marshall13-14">{{Harvnb|Marshall|Jordon|1951|pp=13–14}}</ref>

A significant event in the early development of rugby football was the production of the first written laws of the game at Rugby School in 1845,<ref>{{Harvnb|Godwin|Rhys|1981|p=9}}</ref><ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-coventry-warwickshire-25946757 "Six ways the town of Rugby helped change the world"].

===First internationals===
The [[1871 England versus Scotland rugby union match|first rugby football international]] was played on 27 March 1871 between [[Scottish Rugby Union|Scotland]] and [[England national rugby union team|England]] in [[Edinburgh]]. Scotland won the game 1-0.<ref name="Godwin10"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/timeline1870s.htm|title=Historical Rugby Milestones 1870s|publisher=Rugby Football History|accessdate=22 March 2015}}</ref> By 1881 both Ireland and Wales had representative teams, and in 1883 the first international competition, the [[Six Nations Championship|Home Nations Championship]] had begun. 1883 is also the year of the first [[rugby sevens]] tournament, the [[Melrose Sevens]],<ref name="Godwin12">{{Harvnb|Godwin|Rhys|1981|p=12}}</ref> which is still held annually.

Two important overseas tours took place in 1888: a [[1888 British Lions tour to New Zealand and Australia|British Isles]] team visited Australia and New Zealand—although a private venture, it laid the foundations for future [[British and Irish Lions]] tours;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lionsrugby.com/history/5023.php |title=1888 Australia & New Zealand |publisher=The British and irish Lions |accessdate=13 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607033526/http://www.lionsrugby.com/history/5023.php |archivedate=7 June 2011 }}</ref> and the [[1888–89 New Zealand Native football team]] brought the first overseas team to British spectators.<ref>{{cite book |title=Forerunners of the All Blacks |last=Ryan |first=Greg |publisher=Canterbury University Press |year=1993 |location=Christchurch, New Zealand|isbn=0-908812-30-2|page=44}}</ref>

During the early history of rugby union, a time before commercial air travel, teams from different continents rarely met. The first two notable tours both took place in 1888{{mdash}}the British Isles team touring New Zealand and Australia,<ref name="Lions history">{{cite news|url=http://www.lionsrugby.com/history/potted_history.php |title=The History |publisher=lionsrugby.com |accessdate=24 September 2011}}</ref> followed by the New Zealand team touring Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irb.com/history/halloffame/newsid=2027752.html |title=IRB Hall of Fame Welcomes Five Inductees |publisher=International Rugby Board |date=23 November 2008 |accessdate=24 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100824065112/http://www.irb.com/history/halloffame/newsid=2027752.html |archivedate=24 August 2010 }}</ref> Traditionally the most prestigious tours were the Southern Hemisphere countries of Australia, New Zealand and South Africa making a tour of a Northern Hemisphere, and the return tours made by a joint British and Irish team.<ref>{{Harvnb|Griffiths|1987|p=ix}} ''"In the first century of rugby union's history the IRB only recognised matches with international status if both teams in a match came from a small pool of countries: Australia, British Lions, England, France, Ireland, New Zealand, Scotland, South Africa and Wales."''</ref> Tours would last for months, due to long traveling times and the number of games undertaken; the 1888 New Zealand team began their tour in Hawkes Bay in June and did not complete their schedule until August 1889, having played 107 rugby matches.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/culture/the-new-zealand-natives-rugby-tour/nz-natives-rugby-tour |title=New Zealand Natives' rugby tour of 1888–9 |publisher=New Zealand History Online |accessdate=24 September 2011}}</ref>  Touring international sides would play Test matches against international opponents, including national, club and county sides in the case of Northern Hemisphere rugby, or provincial/state sides in the case of Southern Hemisphere rugby.<ref name="Lions history"/><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.espnscrum.com/scrum/rugby/page/78377.html |title=Take a trip down memory lane courtesy of our historian John Griffiths |publisher=espnscrum.com |date=23 November 2008 |accessdate=6 October 2011}} ''"1 October: The original Wallabies beat a strong Gloucestershire XV 16–0 at Kingsholm, 2 October: The Invincible Second All Blacks have their toughest tour assignment when they are considered lucky to scrape home 13–10 against a star-studded Newport XV, 2 October: Argentina serve notice of their rapidly rising rugby stock by beating a Cardiff side captained by Gerald Davies."''</ref>

Between 1905 and 1908, all three major Southern Hemisphere rugby countries sent their first touring teams to the Northern Hemisphere: [[The Original All Blacks|New Zealand]] in 1905, followed by [[1906-07 South Africa rugby union tour|South Africa]] in 1906 and [[1908-09 Australia rugby union tour of Britain|Australia]] in 1908. All three teams brought new styles of play, fitness levels and tactics,<ref name="Godwin, p18">{{Harvnb|Godwin|Rhys|1981|p=18}}</ref> and were far more successful than critics had expected.<ref>{{Harvnb|Thomas|Rowe|1954|p=27}} ''"When they arrived in this country [Britain] they were regarded as an unknown quantity, but it was not anticipated that they would give the stronger British teams a great deal of opposition. The result of the very first match against Devon was regarded as a foregone conclusion by most British followers."''</ref>

The New Zealand 1905 touring team performed a [[Ka Mate|haka]] before each match, leading Welsh Rugby Union administrator [[Tom Williams (rugby player, born 1860)|Tom Williams]] to suggest that Wales player [[Teddy Morgan]] lead the crowd in singing the Welsh National Anthem, ''[[Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau]]'', as a response. After Morgan began singing, the crowd joined in: the first time a national anthem was sung at the start of a sporting event.<ref>{{cite web|title=The anthem in more recent years|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/music/sites/anthem/pages/anthem-today.shtml|accessdate=3 December 2010 |publisher=[[BBC Cymru Wales]]|date=1 December 2008 |work=[[BBC Cymru Wales|BBC Cymru Wales history]]}}</ref>{{refn|group=nb|Although the United States national anthem, "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]", was first sung before baseball games in the mid-19th century, it did not become the official national anthem until 1931.

Rugby union was included as an event in the Olympic Games four times during the early 20th century. No international rugby games and union-sponsored club matches were played during the First World War, but competitions continued through service teams such as the [[New Zealand Army rugby team of 1919|New Zealand Army team]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Godwin|Rhys|1981|p=19}}</ref> During the Second World War no international matches were played by most countries, though Italy, Germany and Romania played a limited number of games,<ref>[http://www.scrum.com/italy/rugby/match/19590.html Italy tour&nbsp;– Bucharest, 14 April 1940] Romania vs Italy, Scrum.com</ref><ref>[http://www.scrum.com/italy/rugby/match/19591.html Italy tour&nbsp;– Stuttgart, 5 May 1940] Germany vs Italy, Scrum.com</ref><ref>[http://www.scrum.com/italy/rugby/match/19592.html Romania tour&nbsp;– Milan, 2 May 1942] Italy vs Romania, Scrum.com</ref> and [[Cambridge University R.U.F.C.|Cambridge]] and [[Oxford University RFC|Oxford]] continued their annual [[The Varsity Match|University Match]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Godwin|Rhys|1981|p=22}}</ref>

The first officially sanctioned international rugby sevens tournament took place in 1973 at Murrayfield, one of Scotland's biggest stadiums, as part of the [[Scottish Rugby Union]] centenary celebrations.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rugby in the Olympics: Future |url=http://www.irb.com/rugbyandtheolympics/future.html |work=[[International Rugby Board|IRB]] |accessdate=18 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810065813/http://www.irb.com/rugbyandtheolympics/future.html |archivedate=10 August 2011 }}</ref>

===World Cup and professionalism===
In 1987 the first Rugby World Cup was held in Australia and New Zealand, and the inaugural winners were New Zealand. The first World Cup Sevens tournament was held at Murrayfield in 1993. Rugby Sevens was introduced into the [[Commonwealth Rugby Sevens Championships|Commonwealth Games]] in 1998 and was added to the Olympic Games of 2016.<ref name="I.O.C. Decision"/>

Rugby union was an amateur sport until the IRB declared the game "open" in August 1995 (shortly after the completion of the 1995 World Cup), removing restrictions on payments to players.<ref name=Stubbs3>{{Harvnb|Stubbs|2009|p=118}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=History of the RFU |url=http://www.rfu.com/AboutTheRFU/History.aspx |work=[[Rugby Football Union|RFU]] |accessdate=28 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100422210444/http://www.rfu.com/AboutTheRFU/History.aspx |archivedate=22 April 2010 }}</ref> However, the pre-1995 period of rugby union was marked by frequent accusations of "[[shamateurism]]",<ref>{{cite news|title = Ontario: The Shamateurs|url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,804253,00.html|work=TIME |date=29 September 1947|accessdate =6 February 2010}}</ref> including an investigation in Britain by a House of Commons Select committee in early 1995.<ref>{{cite news

===Forwards===
The main responsibilities of the forward players are to gain and retain possession of the ball.<ref name="talkrugby">{{cite web|url=http://www.talkrugbyunion.co.uk/guides/rugby_union_positions.html |title=Rugby Union Positions |publisher=talkrugbyunion.co.uk |accessdate=13 August 2011}}</ref> Players in these positions are generally bigger and stronger and take part in the scrum and line-out.<ref name="talkrugby"/> The forwards are often collectively referred to as the 'pack', especially when in the scrum formation.<ref name="Glossary">{{cite web|url=http://www.espnscrum.com/scrum/rugby/page/97263.html|work=ESPN Scrum.com |title=Rugby Glossary |accessdate=13 August 2011}}</ref>

'''Front row'''<br />
The front row consists of three players: two props (the loosehead prop and the tighthead prop) and the hooker. The role of the two props is to support the hooker during scrums, to provide support for the jumpers during line-outs and to provide strength and power in rucks and mauls. The third position in the front row is the hooker. The hooker is a key position in attacking and defensive play and is responsible for winning the ball in the scrum. Hookers normally throw the ball in at line-outs.<ref name="IRB BGRU 6"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://rugbycoaching.net/rugby-coaching/rugby-positions-explained/|title=Rugby Positions Explained|publisher=Rugby Coaching|accessdate=30 September 2012}}</ref>

'''Second row'''<br />
The second row consists of two locks or lock forwards. Locks are usually the tallest players in the team, and specialize as line-out jumpers.<ref name="IRB BGRU 6"/> The main role of the lock in line-outs is to make a standing jump, often supported by the other forwards, to either collect the thrown ball or ensure the ball comes down on their side. Locks also have an important role in the scrum, binding directly behind the three front row players and providing forward drive.<ref name="IRB BGRU 6"/>
[[File:Chabal Rugby Racing vs Stade Toulousain 311009.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sébastien Chabal]] (far left) in number eight position before entering the scrum.|alt=Facing right a group of seven men, in blue and white hooped jersey, bind together and crouch to form a scrum, the eighth player stands behind them observing the off-picture opposition.]]
'''Back row'''<br />
The back row, not to be confused with ‘Backs’, is the third and final row of the forward positions, they are often referred to as the loose forwards.<ref name="Glossary"/> The three positions in the back row are the two flankers and the number 8. The two flanker positions called the blindside flanker and openside flanker, are the final row in the scrum. They are usually the most mobile forwards in the game. Their main role is to win possession through 'turn overs'.<ref name="IRB BGRU 6"/> The number 8 packs down between the two locks at the back of the scrum. The role of the number 8 in the scrum is to control the ball after it has been heeled back from the front of the pack and the position provides a link between the forwards and backs during attacking phases.<ref name="IRB BGRU 7">{{cite web|url=https://passport.worldrugby.org/beginners_guide/downloads/Beginners_Guide_2015_EN.pdf|work=[[World Rugby]] |title=A Beginner's Guide to Rugby Union |page=7|accessdate=28 September 2015}}</ref>

===Backs===
The backs' role is to create and convert point-scoring opportunities. They are generally smaller, faster and more agile than the forwards.<ref name="talkrugby"/> Another distinction between the backs and the forwards is that the backs are expected to have superior kicking and ball-handling skills, especially the fly-half, scrum-half, and full-back.<ref name="talkrugby"/>

'''Half-backs'''<br />
The half-backs consist of two positions, the scrum-half and the fly-half. The fly-half is crucial to a team's game plan, orchestrating the team's performance.<ref name="IRB BGRU 7"/> They are usually the first to receive the ball from the scrum-half following a breakdown, lineout, or scrum, and need to be decisive with what actions to take and be effective at communicating with the outside backs.<ref name="IRB BGRU 7"/> Many fly-halves are also their team's goal kickers. The scrum-half is the link between the forwards and the backs.<ref name="IRB BGRU 7"/> They receive the ball from the lineout and remove the ball from the back of the scrum, usually passing it to the fly-half.<ref name="IRB BGRU 8">{{cite web|url=https://passport.worldrugby.org/beginners_guide/downloads/Beginners_Guide_2015_EN.pdf|work=[[World Rugby]] |title=A Beginner's Guide to Rugby Union |page=8|accessdate=28 September 2015}}</ref> They also feed the scrum and sometimes have to act as a fourth loose forward.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bompa|Claro|2008|p=62}}</ref>

'''Three quarters'''<br />
There are four three quarter positions, the inside centre, outside centre and left and right wings. The centres will attempt to tackle attacking players; whilst in attack, they should employ speed and strength to breach opposition defences.<ref name="IRB BGRU 7"/> The wings are generally positioned on the outside of the backline. Their primary function is to finish off moves and score tries.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brown, Guthrie and Growden|(2010)}}</ref> Wings are usually the fastest players in the team and are elusive runners who use their speed to avoid tackles.<ref>{{cite news|title=Scottish rugby welcomes back Lomu|date=7 January 2006|first=David|last=Ferguson |url=http://sport.scotsman.com/superteams/Scottish-rugby-welcomes-back-Lomu.2740238.jp|newspaper=Scotsman|accessdate=1 September 2011}}</ref>

'''Fullback'''<br />
The fullback normally position themselves several metres behind the back line. They often field opposition kicks and are usually the last line of defence should an opponent break through the back line.<ref name="IRB BGRU 7"/> Two of the most important attributes of a good fullback are dependable catching skills and a good kicking game.<ref name = "MacDonald">{{cite book|title=Rugger Practice and Tactics&nbsp;– A Manual of Rugby Football Technique |first=H.

===Scoring===
Rugby union is played between two teams&nbsp;– the one that scores more points wins the game. Points can be scored in several ways: a [[try]], scored by grounding the ball in the in-goal area (between the goal line and the dead-ball line), is worth 5 points and a subsequent conversion kick scores 2 points; a successful penalty kick or a [[drop goal]] each score 3 points.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://laws.worldrugby.org/downloads/World_Rugby_Laws_2015_EN.pdf |work=[[World Rugby]] |title=Law 9 Method of Scoring |format=PDF |accessdate=28 September 2015 |pages=62–65 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216025124/http://laws.worldrugby.org/downloads/World_Rugby_Laws_2015_EN.pdf |archivedate=16 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The values of each of these scoring methods have been changed over the years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/scoring.htm |title=Scoring through the ages |work=rugbyfootballhistory.com  |accessdate=16 August 2011}}</ref>

===Playing field===
The field of play on a rugby pitch is as near as possible to a maximum of {{convert|144|m|yd}} long by {{convert|70|m|yd}} wide.<ref name="pitch size">{{cite web |url=http://laws.worldrugby.org/downloads/World_Rugby_Laws_2015_EN.pdf |title=Law 1: The Ground |pages=25–30 |work=[[World Rugby]] |format=PDF |accessdate=28 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216025124/http://laws.worldrugby.org/downloads/World_Rugby_Laws_2015_EN.pdf |archivedate=16 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In actual gameplay there should be a maximum of {{convert|100|m|yd|0}} between the two try-lines, with anywhere between 10 and 22 metres behind each try line to serve as the in-goal area.<ref name="pitch size"/> Several lines cross the field, notably the halfway line and the "twenty-two", which is {{convert|22|m|yd|0}} from the goal line.<ref name="pitch size"/>

Stricter rules apply to the pitch size for matches between national representative teams. The same maximums apply in this case, but the distance between the two try-lines must also be at least {{convert|94|m|yd}} and the pitch must be at least {{convert|68|m|yd}} wide.<ref name="pitch size"/>

Rugby goalposts are H-shaped, and consist of two poles, {{convert|5.6|m|yd}} apart, connected by a horizontal crossbar {{convert|3|m|yd}} above the ground.<ref name="pitch size"/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/rugby_union/six_nations/618637.stm |title=A beginner's guide to ... rugby laws |work=BBC |date=31 January 2000 |accessdate=24 September 2011}}</ref>

===Match structure===
At the beginning of the game, the captains and the referee toss a coin to decide which team will kick off first. Play then starts with a dropkick, with the players chasing the ball into the opposition's territory, and the other side trying to retrieve the ball and advance it. If the ball does not reach the opponent's 10-metre line the opposing team has two choices: to have the ball kicked off again, or to have a [[scrum (rugby union)|scrum]] at the centre of the half-way line.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://laws.worldrugby.org/downloads/World_Rugby_Laws_2015_EN.pdf |format=PDF |work=[[World Rugby]] |pages=85–91 |title=Law 13 Kick-off and Restart Kicks |accessdate=28 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216025124/http://laws.worldrugby.org/downloads/World_Rugby_Laws_2015_EN.pdf |archivedate=16 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>
If the player with the ball is tackled, frequently a [[Playing rugby union#Ruck|ruck]] will result.<ref name=Midgley>{{Cite book| last = Midgley| first = Ruth| title = The Official World Encyclopedia of Sports and Games| publisher=Diagram Group| year = 1979| location = London| url =|page=394 | isbn = 0-7092-0153-2}}</ref>

Games are divided into 40-minute halves, with a [[Half-time|break]] in the middle.<ref name="IRBLaw5">{{cite web |url=http://laws.worldrugby.org/downloads/World_Rugby_Laws_2015_EN.pdf |title=Law 5: Time |work=[[World Rugby]] |pages=45–47 |format=PDF |accessdate=27 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216025124/http://laws.worldrugby.org/downloads/World_Rugby_Laws_2015_EN.pdf |archivedate=16 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The sides exchange ends of the field after the half-time break.<ref name="IRBLaw5"/> Stoppages for injury or to allow the referee to take disciplinary action do not count as part of the playing time, so that the elapsed time is usually longer than 80 minutes.<ref name="IRBLaw5"/> The referee is responsible for keeping time, even when—as in many professional tournaments—he is assisted by an official time-keeper.<ref name="IRBLaw5"/> If time expires while the ball is in play, the game continues until the ball is "dead", and only then will the referee blow the whistle to signal half-time or full-time; but if the referee awards a penalty or free-kick, the game continues.<ref name="IRBLaw5"/>

In the knockout stages of rugby competitions, most notably the [[Rugby World Cup]], two extra time periods of 10 minutes periods are played (with an interval of 5 minutes in between) if the game is tied after full-time. If scores are level after 100 minutes then the rules call for 20 minutes of sudden-death extra time to be played. If the sudden-death extra time period results in no scoring a kicking competition is used to determine the winner. However, no match in the history of the Rugby World Cup has ever gone past 100 minutes into a sudden-death extra time period.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irb.com/jwrt/rules/index.html |title=IRB Laws&nbsp;– Time |date=7 December 2013 |accessdate=7 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080325160709/http://www.irb.com/jwrt/rules/index.html |archivedate=25 March 2008 }}</ref>

Forward passing (throwing the ball ahead to another player) is not allowed; the ball can be passed laterally or backwards.<ref name="irblaws12">{{cite web |url=http://laws.worldrugby.org/downloads/World_Rugby_Laws_2015_EN.pdf |title=Law 12 Knock-on or Throw Forward |publisher=[[World Rugby]] |accessdate=28 September 2015 |pages=81–83 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216025124/http://laws.worldrugby.org/downloads/World_Rugby_Laws_2015_EN.pdf |archivedate=16 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The ball tends to be moved forward in three ways&nbsp;— by kicking, by a player running with it or within a scrum or [[Playing rugby union#Maul|maul]].

When a player anywhere in the playing area kicks indirectly into [[Touch (rugby)|touch]] so that the ball first bounces in the field of play, the throw-in is taken where the ball went into touch.<ref name="WRlaw19">{{cite web |url=http://laws.worldrugby.org/downloads/World_Rugby_Laws_2015_EN.pdf |title=Law 19 Touch and Lineout |publisher=[[World Rugby]] |accessdate=28 September 2015 |pages=117–137 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216025124/http://laws.worldrugby.org/downloads/World_Rugby_Laws_2015_EN.pdf |archivedate=16 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> If the player kicks directly into touch (i.e. without bouncing in-field first) from within one's own 22-metre line, the lineout is taken by the opposition where the ball went into touch, but if the ball is kicked into touch directly by a player outside the 22-metre line, the lineout is taken level to where the kick was taken.<ref name="WRlaw19"/>

===Breakdowns===
[[File:Schoolkids doing a rugby tackle.jpg|thumb|right|180px|A rugby tackle: tackles must be below the neck with the aim of impeding or grounding the player with the ball|alt=A child running away from camera in green and black hooped rugby jersey is in the process of being tackled around the hips and legs by an opponent]]
The aim of the defending side is to stop the player with the ball, either by bringing them to ground (a tackle, which is frequently followed by a ruck) or by contesting for possession with the ball-carrier on their feet (a maul). Such a circumstance is called a breakdown and each is governed by a specific law.

'''Tackling'''

A player may tackle an opposing player who has the ball by holding them while bringing them to ground. Tacklers cannot tackle above the shoulder (the neck and head are out of bounds),<ref name="10.4e">{{cite web |url=http://www.irblaws.com/index.php?law=10 |title=Law 10 Foul play |page=10.4(e) |publisher=[[International Rugby Board|IRB]] |accessdate=26 April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022230153/http://www.irblaws.com/index.php?law=10 |archive-date=22 October 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and the tackler has to attempt to wrap their arms around the player being tackled to complete the tackle. It is illegal to push, shoulder-charge, or to trip a player using feet or legs, but hands may be used (this being referred to as a tap-tackle or [[Ankle tap|ankle-tap]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.irblaws.com/index.php?law=10 |title=Law 10 Foul play |page=10.4(d) |publisher=[[International Rugby Board|IRB]] |accessdate=27 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209111927/http://www.irblaws.com/index.php?law=10 |archive-date=9 February 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.irblaws.com/index.php?law=10 |title=Law 10 Foul play |page=10.4(g) |publisher=[[International Rugby Board|IRB]] |accessdate=27 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209111927/http://www.irblaws.com/index.php?law=10 |archive-date=9 February 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Tacklers may not tackle an opponent who has jumped to catch a ball until the player has landed.<ref name="10.4e"/>

'''Rucking and Mauling'''

Mauls occur after a player with the ball has come into contact with an opponent but the handler remains on his feet; once any combination of at least three players have bound themselves a maul has been set.<ref name="Glossary"/> A ruck is similar to the maul, but in this case the ball has gone to ground with at least three attacking players binding themselves on the ground in an attempt to secure the ball.<ref name="Glossary"/>

===Set pieces===

====Lineout====

When the ball leaves the side of the field, a [[line-out (rugby union)|line-out]] is awarded against the team which last touched the ball.<ref name="irblaws19">{{cite web |url=http://www.irblaws.com/index.php?law=19 |title=Law 19 Touch and Lineout |publisher=[[International Rugby Board|IRB]] |accessdate=27 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209104345/http://www.irblaws.com/index.php?law=19 |archive-date=9 February 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Forward players from each team line up a metre apart, perpendicular to the touchline and between 5 m and 15 m from the touchline.<ref name="irblaws19"/> The ball is thrown from the touchline down the centre of the lines of forwards by a player (usually the [[hooker (rugby union)|hooker]]) from the team that did not play the ball into touch.<ref name="irblaws19"/> The exception to this is when the ball went out from a penalty, in which case the side who gained the penalty throws the ball in.<ref name="irblaws19"/>

A team may also opt for a scrum if awarded a penalty.<ref name="WRlaw20"/>

A scrum is formed by the eight forwards from each team binding together in three rows.<ref name="WRlaw20"/> The front row consists of the two props (loosehead and tighthead) either side of the hooker.<ref name="WRlaw20"/> The second row consists of two locks and the two flankers.

Common offences include tackling above the shoulders, collapsing a [[Scrum (rugby union)|scrum]], ruck or maul, not releasing the ball when on the ground, or being offside.<ref name="WRLaw10">{{cite web |url=http://laws.worldrugby.org/downloads/World_Rugby_Laws_2015_EN.pdf |title=Law 10: Foul Play |work=[[World Rugby]] |format=PDF |pages=66–74 |accessdate=28 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216025124/http://laws.worldrugby.org/downloads/World_Rugby_Laws_2015_EN.pdf |archivedate=16 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The non-offending team has a number of options when awarded a penalty: a "tap" kick, when the ball is kicked a very short distance from hand, allowing the kicker to regather the ball and run with it; a punt, when the ball is kicked a long distance from hand, for field position; a place-kick, when the kicker will attempt to score a goal; or a scrum.<ref name="WRLaw10"/> Players may be sent off (signalled by a [[Red card (sports)|red card]]) or temporarily suspended ("sin-binned") for ten minutes ([[Yellow card (sport)|yellow card]]) for foul play or repeated infringements, and may not be replaced.<ref name="WRLaw10"/>

Occasionally, infringements are not caught by the referee during the match and these may be "cited" by the [[citing commissioner]] after the match and have punishments (usually suspension for a number of weeks) imposed on the infringing player.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ercrugby.com/eng/heinekencup/rules/index.php |title=European Club Rugby: Key Tournament Rules |work=ercrugby.com |accessdate=24 October 2011}}</ref>

===Replacements and substitutions===
During the match, players may be replaced (for injury) or substituted (for tactical reasons).<ref name="Law3"/> A player who has been replaced may not rejoin play unless he was temporarily replaced to have bleeding controlled; a player who has been substituted may return temporarily, to replace a player who has a blood injury or has suffered a concussion, or permanently, if he is replacing a front-row forward.<ref name="Law3"/> In international matches, eight replacements are allowed; in domestic or cross-border tournaments, at the discretion of the responsible national union(s), the number of replacements may be nominated to a maximum of eight, of whom three must be sufficiently trained and experienced to provide cover for the three front row positions.<ref name="Law3"/><ref name="Uncontested">{{cite web|url=http://www.irb.com/newsmedia/mediazone/pressrelease/newsid=2033086.html#irb+acts+uncontested+scrums |title=IRB acts on uncontested scrums |publisher=[[World Rugby|International Rugby Board]] |date=19 August 2009 |accessdate=23 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822203000/http://www.irb.com/newsmedia/mediazone/pressrelease/newsid=2033086.html |archivedate=22 August 2009 }}</ref>

Prior to 2016, all substitutions, no matter the cause, counted against the limit during a match. In 2016, [[World Rugby]] changed the law so that substitutions made to replace a player deemed unable to continue due to foul play by the opposition would no longer count against the match limit. This change was introduced in January of that year in the Southern Hemisphere and June in the Northern Hemisphere.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/rugby/story/_/id/15885158/world-rugby-introduces-new-rules-stop-simulation |title=World Rugby introduces new rules to stop simulation |publisher=[[ESPN (UK)]] |date=1 June 2016 |accessdate=4 June 2016}}</ref>

Although the exact date of arrival of [[rugby union in Trinidad and Tobago]] is unknown, their first club Northern RFC was formed in 1923, a national team was playing by 1927 and due to a cancelled tour to [[British Guiana]] in 1933, switched their venue to [[Rugby union in Barbados|Barbados]]; introducing rugby to the island.<ref>{{Harvnb|Godwin|Rhys|1981|p=160}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Godwin|Rhys|1981|p=43}}</ref> Other Atlantic countries to play rugby union include [[Rugby union in Jamaica|Jamaica]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irb.com/unions/union=11000064/index.html |title=Jamaica |work=[[World Rugby|IRB]] |accessdate=6 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928002800/http://www.irb.com/unions/union=11000064/index.html |archivedate=28 September 2011 }}</ref> and [[Rugby union in Bermuda|Bermuda]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irb.com/unions/union=11000040/index.html |title=Bermuda |work=[[World Rugby|IRB]] |accessdate=6 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110915192248/http://www.irb.com/unions/union=11000040/index.html |archivedate=15 September 2011 }}</ref>

===Europe===
[[File:Germany vs Belgium rugby match.jpg|thumb|Germany playing [[Belgium national rugby union team|Belgium]]]]
The growth of rugby union in Europe outside the 6 Nations countries in terms of playing numbers has been sporadic. Historically, British and Irish home teams played the Southern Hemisphere teams of Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, as well as France. The rest of Europe were let to play amongst themselves. During a period when it had been isolated by the British and Irish Unions, France, lacking international competition, became the only European team from the top tier to regularly play the other European countries; mainly [[Rugby union in Belgium|Belgium]], the [[Rugby union in the Netherlands|Netherlands]], [[Rugby union in Germany|Germany]], [[Rugby union in Spain|Spain]], [[Rugby union in Romania|Romania]], [[Rugby union in Poland|Poland]], [[Rugby union in Italy|Italy]] and [[Rugby union in Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia]].<ref name="FIRA"/><ref>{{cite book |last=Dine |first=Philip |title=French Rugby Football |year=2001 |pages=79–94|publisher=Berg |location=Oxford |isbn=1-85973-327-1}}</ref> In 1934, instigated by the [[French Rugby Federation]], FIRA (Fédération Internationale de Rugby Amateur) was formed to organise rugby union outside the authority of the IRFB.<ref name="FIRA"/> The founding members were {{runion|ITA}}, {{runion|ROM}}, {{runion|NLD}}, {{runion|POR}}, {{runion|CSK}}, and {{runion|SWE}}.

Other European rugby playing nations of note include [[Rugby union in Russia|Russia]], whose first officially recorded match is marked by an encounter between Dynamo Moscow and the Moscow Institute of Physical Education in 1933.<ref>{{Harvnb|Godwin|Rhys|1981|p=148}}</ref> [[Rugby union in Portugal]] also took hold between the First and Second World Wars, with a Portuguese National XV set up in 1922 and an official championship started in 1927.<ref>{{Harvnb|Godwin|Rhys|1981|p=130}}</ref>

In 1999, FIRA agreed to place itself under the auspices of the IRB, transforming itself into a strictly European organising body. Accordingly, it changed its name to FIRA–AER (Fédération Internationale de Rugby Amateur – Association Européenne de Rugby). It adopted its current name of [[Rugby Europe]] in 2014.

===South America===

===Asia===
{{main|Rugby union in Asia}}
Many Asian countries have a tradition of playing rugby dating from the British Empire. [[Rugby union in India|India]] began playing rugby in the early 1870s, the [[Calcutta Football Club]] forming in 1873. However, with the departure of a local British army regiment, interest in rugby diminished in the area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofBritain/The-Calcutta-Cup/|title=The History of the Calcutta Cup|publisher=}}</ref> In 1878, The Calcutta Football Club was disbanded, and rugby in India faltered.<ref>{{Harvnb|Godwin|Rhys|1981|p=92}}</ref> [[Rugby union in Sri Lanka|Sri Lanka]] claims to have founded their union in 1878, and although little official information from the period is available, the team won the All-India cup in Madras in 1920.<ref>{{Harvnb|Godwin|Rhys|1981|p=152}}</ref> The first recorded match in [[Rugby union in Malaysia|Malaysia]] was in 1892, but the first confirmation of rugby is the existence of the ''HMS Malaya Cup'' which was first presented in 1922 and is still awarded to the winners of the Malay sevens.<ref>{{Harvnb|Godwin|Rhys|1981|pp=112–113}}</ref>

Rugby in the Middle East and the Gulf States has its history in the 1950s, with clubs formed by British and French Services stationed in the region after the Second World War.<ref>{{Harvnb|Godwin|Rhys|1981|p=42}}</ref> When these servicemen left, the clubs and teams were kept alive by young professionals, mostly Europeans, working in these countries.

===Africa===
In 1875, rugby was introduced to [[Rugby union in South Africa|South Africa]] by British soldiers garrisoned in Cape Town.<ref name="Godwin11"/> During the late 19th and early 20th century, the sport in Africa was spread by settlers and colonials who often adopted a "whites-only" policy to playing the game.

The Rugby Championship is the Southern Hemisphere's annual international series for that region's top national teams.

==Variants==
{{main|Rugby sevens}}
[[File:Spielszene BK.jpg|thumb|[[Beach rugby]] match|alt=On a sunlit beach two teams of players, one in yellow the other in blue, play a form of rugby; the central yellow player runs forward clutching the ball with one hand, close to his chest.]]

The game of rugby union has spawned several variants of the full-contact, 15-a-side code. The two more common differences applied to the variants of the sport lie in either fewer players or reduced player contact. Of the variants, the oldest is [[Rugby sevens]] (7s, or VIIs), a fast-paced variant which originated in [[Melrose, Scotland|Melrose]], Scotland in 1883. In rugby sevens, there are only seven players per side, and each half is normally seven minutes.

Major tournaments include the [[Hong Kong Sevens]] and [[Dubai Sevens]], both held in areas not normally associated with the highest levels of the 15-a-side game.

[[File:Tom Wills 1857.jpg|thumb|When codifying [[Australian rules football]] in 1859, [[Tom Wills]] drew inspiration from an early version of rugby he learnt at Rugby School.]]
[[Rugby league]] was formed as an administrative break from the English union before changing its laws, becoming a code in its own right. The two sports continue to influence each other to this day.

'''Rugby union''', commonly known in most of the world simply as '''rugby''',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.worldrugby.org/welcome-to-rugby/what-is-rugby|title=What is Rugby?|publisher=World Rugby|accessdate=28 March 2018}}</ref> is a [[Contact sport#Terminology|contact]] [[team sport]] which originated in [[England]] in the first half of the 19th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/originsofrugby.htm#2 |title=Origins of Rugby&nbsp;– Codification "The innovation of running with the ball was introduced some time between 1820 and 1830." |publisher=Rugbyfootballhistory.com |accessdate=15 August 2011}}</ref> One of the [[Comparison of rugby league and rugby union|two codes]] of [[rugby football]], it is based on running with the ball in hand.  In its most common form, a game is between two teams of 15 players using an oval-shaped [[rugby ball|ball]] on a rectangular field with H-shaped goalposts at each end.

Rugby union is a popular sport around the world, played by male and female players of all ages. In 2014, there were more than 6 million people playing worldwide, of whom 2.36 million were registered players. [[World Rugby]], previously called the International Rugby Football Board (IRFB) and the International Rugby Board (IRB), has been the governing body for rugby union since 1886, and currently has 101 countries as full members and 18 associate members.

In 1845, the first football laws were written by [[Rugby School]] pupils; other significant events in the early development of rugby include the [[Blackheath F.C.|Blackheath Club]]'s decision to leave [[the Football Association]] in 1863 and the [[History of rugby league|split]] between rugby union and [[rugby league]] in 1895.  Historically an amateur sport, in 1995 restrictions on payments to players were removed, making the game openly professional at the highest level for the first time.<ref>{{cite news|last=Scianitti|first=Matthew|title=The world awaits for Canada's rugby team|url=http://sports.nationalpost.com/2011/06/18/the-world-awaits-for-canadas-rugby-team/|accessdate=22 March 2015|newspaper=[[National Post]]|date=18 June 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130129194424/http://sports.nationalpost.com/2011/06/18/the-world-awaits-for-canadas-rugby-team/|archivedate=29 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Rugby union spread from the [[Home Nations]] of Great Britain and Ireland and was absorbed by many of the countries associated with the [[British Empire]]. Early exponents of the sport included Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and France. Countries that have adopted rugby union as their ''de facto'' [[national sport]] include Fiji, Georgia, Madagascar,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.irb.com/newsmedia/regional/newsid=53025.html |accessdate=1 December 2013 |title=Madagascar take Sevens honours |date=23 August 2007 |publisher=International Rugby Board |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AGpxxkZd?url=http://www.irb.com/newsmedia/regional/newsid=53025.html |archivedate=29 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref> New Zealand, Samoa and Tonga.

International matches have taken place since 1871 when the first game took place between Scotland and England at Raeburn Place in Edinburgh. The [[Rugby World Cup]], first held in 1987, takes place every four years. The [[Six Nations Championship]] in Europe and [[The Rugby Championship]] in the Southern Hemisphere are other major international competitions, held annually.

National club or provincial competitions include the [[Premiership Rugby|Premiership]] in England, the [[Top 14]] in France, the [[Mitre 10 Cup]] in New Zealand, the [[National Rugby Championship]] in Australia, and the [[Currie Cup]] in South Africa. Other transnational club competitions include the [[Pro14]] in Europe and South Africa, the [[European Rugby Champions Cup]] solely in Europe, and [[Super Rugby]], in the Southern Hemisphere and Japan.

{{wikisource|Laws of Football as played at Rugby_School}}

The origin of rugby football is reputed to be an incident during a game of [[English public school football games|English school football]] at Rugby School in 1823, when [[William Webb Ellis]] is said to have picked up the ball and run with it.<ref>{{cite web|title = Webb Ellis, William|url = http://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/webb-ellis.html|accessdate =14 September 2009}}</ref> Although the evidence for the story is doubtful, it was immortalised at the school with a [[commemorative plaque|plaque]] unveiled in 1895.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Flotsam|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/qi/episodes/6/3/|series=QI|serieslink=QI|network=[[BBC]]|station=BBC One |location=UK|airdate=9 January 2009|seriesno=F|number=3}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title = William Webb Ellis&nbsp;– fact or fiction?|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/low/rugby_union/6255164.stm |first=Sean|last=Davies|publisher=BBC  |accessdate =20 September 2011|date=10 August 2007}}</ref> Despite the doubtful evidence, the [[Webb Ellis Cup|Rugby World Cup trophy]] is named after Webb Ellis. Rugby football stems from the [[English public school football games|form of game]] played at Rugby School, which former pupils then introduced to their university.

Old Rugbeian [[Albert Pell]], a student at [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]], is credited with having formed the first "football" team.<ref name="Marshall13">{{Harvnb|Marshall|Jordon|1951|p=13}}</ref> During this early period different schools used different rules, with former pupils from Rugby and [[Eton College|Eton]] attempting to carry their preferred rules through to their universities.<ref name="Marshall13-14">{{Harvnb|Marshall|Jordon|1951|pp=13–14}}</ref>

A significant event in the early development of rugby football was the production of the first written laws of the game at Rugby School in 1845,<ref>{{Harvnb|Godwin|Rhys|1981|p=9}}</ref><ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-coventry-warwickshire-25946757 "Six ways the town of Rugby helped change the world"].

===First internationals===
The [[1871 England versus Scotland rugby union match|first rugby football international]] was played on 27 March 1871 between [[Scottish Rugby Union|Scotland]] and [[England national rugby union team|England]] in [[Edinburgh]]. Scotland won the game 1-0.<ref name="Godwin10"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/timeline1870s.htm|title=Historical Rugby Milestones 1870s|publisher=Rugby Football History|accessdate=22 March 2015}}</ref> By 1881 both Ireland and Wales had representative teams, and in 1883 the first international competition, the [[Six Nations Championship|Home Nations Championship]] had begun. 1883 is also the year of the first [[rugby sevens]] tournament, the [[Melrose Sevens]],<ref name="Godwin12">{{Harvnb|Godwin|Rhys|1981|p=12}}</ref> which is still held annually.

Two important overseas tours took place in 1888: a [[1888 British Lions tour to New Zealand and Australia|British Isles]] team visited Australia and New Zealand—although a private venture, it laid the foundations for future [[British and Irish Lions]] tours;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lionsrugby.com/history/5023.php |title=1888 Australia & New Zealand |publisher=The British and irish Lions |accessdate=13 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607033526/http://www.lionsrugby.com/history/5023.php |archivedate=7 June 2011 }}</ref> and the [[1888–89 New Zealand Native football team]] brought the first overseas team to British spectators.<ref>{{cite book |title=Forerunners of the All Blacks |last=Ryan |first=Greg |publisher=Canterbury University Press |year=1993 |location=Christchurch, New Zealand|isbn=0-908812-30-2|page=44}}</ref>

During the early history of rugby union, a time before commercial air travel, teams from different continents rarely met. The first two notable tours both took place in 1888{{mdash}}the British Isles team touring New Zealand and Australia,<ref name="Lions history">{{cite news|url=http://www.lionsrugby.com/history/potted_history.php |title=The History |publisher=lionsrugby.com |accessdate=24 September 2011}}</ref> followed by the New Zealand team touring Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irb.com/history/halloffame/newsid=2027752.html |title=IRB Hall of Fame Welcomes Five Inductees |publisher=International Rugby Board |date=23 November 2008 |accessdate=24 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100824065112/http://www.irb.com/history/halloffame/newsid=2027752.html |archivedate=24 August 2010 }}</ref> Traditionally the most prestigious tours were the Southern Hemisphere countries of Australia, New Zealand and South Africa making a tour of a Northern Hemisphere, and the return tours made by a joint British and Irish team.<ref>{{Harvnb|Griffiths|1987|p=ix}} ''"In the first century of rugby union's history the IRB only recognised matches with international status if both teams in a match came from a small pool of countries: Australia, British Lions, England, France, Ireland, New Zealand, Scotland, South Africa and Wales."''</ref> Tours would last for months, due to long traveling times and the number of games undertaken; the 1888 New Zealand team began their tour in Hawkes Bay in June and did not complete their schedule until August 1889, having played 107 rugby matches.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/culture/the-new-zealand-natives-rugby-tour/nz-natives-rugby-tour |title=New Zealand Natives' rugby tour of 1888–9 |publisher=New Zealand History Online |accessdate=24 September 2011}}</ref>  Touring international sides would play Test matches against international opponents, including national, club and county sides in the case of Northern Hemisphere rugby, or provincial/state sides in the case of Southern Hemisphere rugby.<ref name="Lions history"/><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.espnscrum.com/scrum/rugby/page/78377.html |title=Take a trip down memory lane courtesy of our historian John Griffiths |publisher=espnscrum.com |date=23 November 2008 |accessdate=6 October 2011}} ''"1 October: The original Wallabies beat a strong Gloucestershire XV 16–0 at Kingsholm, 2 October: The Invincible Second All Blacks have their toughest tour assignment when they are considered lucky to scrape home 13–10 against a star-studded Newport XV, 2 October: Argentina serve notice of their rapidly rising rugby stock by beating a Cardiff side captained by Gerald Davies."''</ref>

Between 1905 and 1908, all three major Southern Hemisphere rugby countries sent their first touring teams to the Northern Hemisphere: [[The Original All Blacks|New Zealand]] in 1905, followed by [[1906-07 South Africa rugby union tour|South Africa]] in 1906 and [[1908-09 Australia rugby union tour of Britain|Australia]] in 1908. All three teams brought new styles of play, fitness levels and tactics,<ref name="Godwin, p18">{{Harvnb|Godwin|Rhys|1981|p=18}}</ref> and were far more successful than critics had expected.<ref>{{Harvnb|Thomas|Rowe|1954|p=27}} ''"When they arrived in this country [Britain] they were regarded as an unknown quantity, but it was not anticipated that they would give the stronger British teams a great deal of opposition. The result of the very first match against Devon was regarded as a foregone conclusion by most British followers."''</ref>

The New Zealand 1905 touring team performed a [[Ka Mate|haka]] before each match, leading Welsh Rugby Union administrator [[Tom Williams (rugby player, born 1860)|Tom Williams]] to suggest that Wales player [[Teddy Morgan]] lead the crowd in singing the Welsh National Anthem, ''[[Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau]]'', as a response. After Morgan began singing, the crowd joined in: the first time a national anthem was sung at the start of a sporting event.<ref>{{cite web|title=The anthem in more recent years|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/music/sites/anthem/pages/anthem-today.shtml|accessdate=3 December 2010 |publisher=[[BBC Cymru Wales]]|date=1 December 2008 |work=[[BBC Cymru Wales|BBC Cymru Wales history]]}}</ref>{{refn|group=nb|Although the United States national anthem, "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]", was first sung before baseball games in the mid-19th century, it did not become the official national anthem until 1931.

Rugby union was included as an event in the Olympic Games four times during the early 20th century. No international rugby games and union-sponsored club matches were played during the First World War, but competitions continued through service teams such as the [[New Zealand Army rugby team of 1919|New Zealand Army team]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Godwin|Rhys|1981|p=19}}</ref> During the Second World War no international matches were played by most countries, though Italy, Germany and Romania played a limited number of games,<ref>[http://www.scrum.com/italy/rugby/match/19590.html Italy tour&nbsp;– Bucharest, 14 April 1940] Romania vs Italy, Scrum.com</ref><ref>[http://www.scrum.com/italy/rugby/match/19591.html Italy tour&nbsp;– Stuttgart, 5 May 1940] Germany vs Italy, Scrum.com</ref><ref>[http://www.scrum.com/italy/rugby/match/19592.html Romania tour&nbsp;– Milan, 2 May 1942] Italy vs Romania, Scrum.com</ref> and [[Cambridge University R.U.F.C.|Cambridge]] and [[Oxford University RFC|Oxford]] continued their annual [[The Varsity Match|University Match]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Godwin|Rhys|1981|p=22}}</ref>

The first officially sanctioned international rugby sevens tournament took place in 1973 at Murrayfield, one of Scotland's biggest stadiums, as part of the [[Scottish Rugby Union]] centenary celebrations.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rugby in the Olympics: Future |url=http://www.irb.com/rugbyandtheolympics/future.html |work=[[International Rugby Board|IRB]] |accessdate=18 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810065813/http://www.irb.com/rugbyandtheolympics/future.html |archivedate=10 August 2011 }}</ref>

===World Cup and professionalism===
In 1987 the first Rugby World Cup was held in Australia and New Zealand, and the inaugural winners were New Zealand. The first World Cup Sevens tournament was held at Murrayfield in 1993. Rugby Sevens was introduced into the [[Commonwealth Rugby Sevens Championships|Commonwealth Games]] in 1998 and was added to the Olympic Games of 2016.<ref name="I.O.C. Decision"/>

Rugby union was an amateur sport until the IRB declared the game "open" in August 1995 (shortly after the completion of the 1995 World Cup), removing restrictions on payments to players.<ref name=Stubbs3>{{Harvnb|Stubbs|2009|p=118}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=History of the RFU |url=http://www.rfu.com/AboutTheRFU/History.aspx |work=[[Rugby Football Union|RFU]] |accessdate=28 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100422210444/http://www.rfu.com/AboutTheRFU/History.aspx |archivedate=22 April 2010 }}</ref> However, the pre-1995 period of rugby union was marked by frequent accusations of "[[shamateurism]]",<ref>{{cite news|title = Ontario: The Shamateurs|url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,804253,00.html|work=TIME |date=29 September 1947|accessdate =6 February 2010}}</ref> including an investigation in Britain by a House of Commons Select committee in early 1995.<ref>{{cite news

===Forwards===
The main responsibilities of the forward players are to gain and retain possession of the ball.<ref name="talkrugby">{{cite web|url=http://www.talkrugbyunion.co.uk/guides/rugby_union_positions.html |title=Rugby Union Positions |publisher=talkrugbyunion.co.uk |accessdate=13 August 2011}}</ref> Players in these positions are generally bigger and stronger and take part in the scrum and line-out.<ref name="talkrugby"/> The forwards are often collectively referred to as the 'pack', especially when in the scrum formation.<ref name="Glossary">{{cite web|url=http://www.espnscrum.com/scrum/rugby/page/97263.html|work=ESPN Scrum.com |title=Rugby Glossary |accessdate=13 August 2011}}</ref>

'''Front row'''<br />
The front row consists of three players: two props (the loosehead prop and the tighthead prop) and the hooker. The role of the two props is to support the hooker during scrums, to provide support for the jumpers during line-outs and to provide strength and power in rucks and mauls. The third position in the front row is the hooker. The hooker is a key position in attacking and defensive play and is responsible for winning the ball in the scrum. Hookers normally throw the ball in at line-outs.<ref name="IRB BGRU 6"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://rugbycoaching.net/rugby-coaching/rugby-positions-explained/|title=Rugby Positions Explained|publisher=Rugby Coaching|accessdate=30 September 2012}}</ref>

'''Second row'''<br />
The second row consists of two locks or lock forwards. Locks are usually the tallest players in the team, and specialize as line-out jumpers.<ref name="IRB BGRU 6"/> The main role of the lock in line-outs is to make a standing jump, often supported by the other forwards, to either collect the thrown ball or ensure the ball comes down on their side. Locks also have an important role in the scrum, binding directly behind the three front row players and providing forward drive.<ref name="IRB BGRU 6"/>
[[File:Chabal Rugby Racing vs Stade Toulousain 311009.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sébastien Chabal]] (far left) in number eight position before entering the scrum.|alt=Facing right a group of seven men, in blue and white hooped jersey, bind together and crouch to form a scrum, the eighth player stands behind them observing the off-picture opposition.]]
'''Back row'''<br />
The back row, not to be confused with ‘Backs’, is the third and final row of the forward positions, they are often referred to as the loose forwards.<ref name="Glossary"/> The three positions in the back row are the two flankers and the number 8. The two flanker positions called the blindside flanker and openside flanker, are the final row in the scrum. They are usually the most mobile forwards in the game. Their main role is to win possession through 'turn overs'.<ref name="IRB BGRU 6"/> The number 8 packs down between the two locks at the back of the scrum. The role of the number 8 in the scrum is to control the ball after it has been heeled back from the front of the pack and the position provides a link between the forwards and backs during attacking phases.<ref name="IRB BGRU 7">{{cite web|url=https://passport.worldrugby.org/beginners_guide/downloads/Beginners_Guide_2015_EN.pdf|work=[[World Rugby]] |title=A Beginner's Guide to Rugby Union |page=7|accessdate=28 September 2015}}</ref>

===Backs===
The backs' role is to create and convert point-scoring opportunities. They are generally smaller, faster and more agile than the forwards.<ref name="talkrugby"/> Another distinction between the backs and the forwards is that the backs are expected to have superior kicking and ball-handling skills, especially the fly-half, scrum-half, and full-back.<ref name="talkrugby"/>

'''Half-backs'''<br />
The half-backs consist of two positions, the scrum-half and the fly-half. The fly-half is crucial to a team's game plan, orchestrating the team's performance.<ref name="IRB BGRU 7"/> They are usually the first to receive the ball from the scrum-half following a breakdown, lineout, or scrum, and need to be decisive with what actions to take and be effective at communicating with the outside backs.<ref name="IRB BGRU 7"/> Many fly-halves are also their team's goal kickers. The scrum-half is the link between the forwards and the backs.<ref name="IRB BGRU 7"/> They receive the ball from the lineout and remove the ball from the back of the scrum, usually passing it to the fly-half.<ref name="IRB BGRU 8">{{cite web|url=https://passport.worldrugby.org/beginners_guide/downloads/Beginners_Guide_2015_EN.pdf|work=[[World Rugby]] |title=A Beginner's Guide to Rugby Union |page=8|accessdate=28 September 2015}}</ref> They also feed the scrum and sometimes have to act as a fourth loose forward.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bompa|Claro|2008|p=62}}</ref>

'''Three quarters'''<br />
There are four three quarter positions, the inside centre, outside centre and left and right wings. The centres will attempt to tackle attacking players; whilst in attack, they should employ speed and strength to breach opposition defences.<ref name="IRB BGRU 7"/> The wings are generally positioned on the outside of the backline. Their primary function is to finish off moves and score tries.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brown, Guthrie and Growden|(2010)}}</ref> Wings are usually the fastest players in the team and are elusive runners who use their speed to avoid tackles.<ref>{{cite news|title=Scottish rugby welcomes back Lomu|date=7 January 2006|first=David|last=Ferguson |url=http://sport.scotsman.com/superteams/Scottish-rugby-welcomes-back-Lomu.2740238.jp|newspaper=Scotsman|accessdate=1 September 2011}}</ref>

'''Fullback'''<br />
The fullback normally position themselves several metres behind the back line. They often field opposition kicks and are usually the last line of defence should an opponent break through the back line.<ref name="IRB BGRU 7"/> Two of the most important attributes of a good fullback are dependable catching skills and a good kicking game.<ref name = "MacDonald">{{cite book|title=Rugger Practice and Tactics&nbsp;– A Manual of Rugby Football Technique |first=H.

===Scoring===
Rugby union is played between two teams&nbsp;– the one that scores more points wins the game. Points can be scored in several ways: a [[try]], scored by grounding the ball in the in-goal area (between the goal line and the dead-ball line), is worth 5 points and a subsequent conversion kick scores 2 points; a successful penalty kick or a [[drop goal]] each score 3 points.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://laws.worldrugby.org/downloads/World_Rugby_Laws_2015_EN.pdf |work=[[World Rugby]] |title=Law 9 Method of Scoring |format=PDF |accessdate=28 September 2015 |pages=62–65 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216025124/http://laws.worldrugby.org/downloads/World_Rugby_Laws_2015_EN.pdf |archivedate=16 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The values of each of these scoring methods have been changed over the years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/scoring.htm |title=Scoring through the ages |work=rugbyfootballhistory.com  |accessdate=16 August 2011}}</ref>

===Playing field===
The field of play on a rugby pitch is as near as possible to a maximum of {{convert|144|m|yd}} long by {{convert|70|m|yd}} wide.<ref name="pitch size">{{cite web |url=http://laws.worldrugby.org/downloads/World_Rugby_Laws_2015_EN.pdf |title=Law 1: The Ground |pages=25–30 |work=[[World Rugby]] |format=PDF |accessdate=28 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216025124/http://laws.worldrugby.org/downloads/World_Rugby_Laws_2015_EN.pdf |archivedate=16 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In actual gameplay there should be a maximum of {{convert|100|m|yd|0}} between the two try-lines, with anywhere between 10 and 22 metres behind each try line to serve as the in-goal area.<ref name="pitch size"/> Several lines cross the field, notably the halfway line and the "twenty-two", which is {{convert|22|m|yd|0}} from the goal line.<ref name="pitch size"/>

Stricter rules apply to the pitch size for matches between national representative teams. The same maximums apply in this case, but the distance between the two try-lines must also be at least {{convert|94|m|yd}} and the pitch must be at least {{convert|68|m|yd}} wide.<ref name="pitch size"/>

Rugby goalposts are H-shaped, and consist of two poles, {{convert|5.6|m|yd}} apart, connected by a horizontal crossbar {{convert|3|m|yd}} above the ground.<ref name="pitch size"/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/rugby_union/six_nations/618637.stm |title=A beginner's guide to ... rugby laws |work=BBC |date=31 January 2000 |accessdate=24 September 2011}}</ref>

===Match structure===
At the beginning of the game, the captains and the referee toss a coin to decide which team will kick off first. Play then starts with a dropkick, with the players chasing the ball into the opposition's territory, and the other side trying to retrieve the ball and advance it. If the ball does not reach the opponent's 10-metre line the opposing team has two choices: to have the ball kicked off again, or to have a [[scrum (rugby union)|scrum]] at the centre of the half-way line.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://laws.worldrugby.org/downloads/World_Rugby_Laws_2015_EN.pdf |format=PDF |work=[[World Rugby]] |pages=85–91 |title=Law 13 Kick-off and Restart Kicks |accessdate=28 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216025124/http://laws.worldrugby.org/downloads/World_Rugby_Laws_2015_EN.pdf |archivedate=16 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>
If the player with the ball is tackled, frequently a [[Playing rugby union#Ruck|ruck]] will result.<ref name=Midgley>{{Cite book| last = Midgley| first = Ruth| title = The Official World Encyclopedia of Sports and Games| publisher=Diagram Group| year = 1979| location = London| url =|page=394 | isbn = 0-7092-0153-2}}</ref>

Games are divided into 40-minute halves, with a [[Half-time|break]] in the middle.<ref name="IRBLaw5">{{cite web |url=http://laws.worldrugby.org/downloads/World_Rugby_Laws_2015_EN.pdf |title=Law 5: Time |work=[[World Rugby]] |pages=45–47 |format=PDF |accessdate=27 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216025124/http://laws.worldrugby.org/downloads/World_Rugby_Laws_2015_EN.pdf |archivedate=16 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The sides exchange ends of the field after the half-time break.<ref name="IRBLaw5"/> Stoppages for injury or to allow the referee to take disciplinary action do not count as part of the playing time, so that the elapsed time is usually longer than 80 minutes.<ref name="IRBLaw5"/> The referee is responsible for keeping time, even when—as in many professional tournaments—he is assisted by an official time-keeper.<ref name="IRBLaw5"/> If time expires while the ball is in play, the game continues until the ball is "dead", and only then will the referee blow the whistle to signal half-time or full-time; but if the referee awards a penalty or free-kick, the game continues.<ref name="IRBLaw5"/>

In the knockout stages of rugby competitions, most notably the [[Rugby World Cup]], two extra time periods of 10 minutes periods are played (with an interval of 5 minutes in between) if the game is tied after full-time. If scores are level after 100 minutes then the rules call for 20 minutes of sudden-death extra time to be played. If the sudden-death extra time period results in no scoring a kicking competition is used to determine the winner. However, no match in the history of the Rugby World Cup has ever gone past 100 minutes into a sudden-death extra time period.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irb.com/jwrt/rules/index.html |title=IRB Laws&nbsp;– Time |date=7 December 2013 |accessdate=7 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080325160709/http://www.irb.com/jwrt/rules/index.html |archivedate=25 March 2008 }}</ref>

Forward passing (throwing the ball ahead to another player) is not allowed; the ball can be passed laterally or backwards.<ref name="irblaws12">{{cite web |url=http://laws.worldrugby.org/downloads/World_Rugby_Laws_2015_EN.pdf |title=Law 12 Knock-on or Throw Forward |publisher=[[World Rugby]] |accessdate=28 September 2015 |pages=81–83 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216025124/http://laws.worldrugby.org/downloads/World_Rugby_Laws_2015_EN.pdf |archivedate=16 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The ball tends to be moved forward in three ways&nbsp;— by kicking, by a player running with it or within a scrum or [[Playing rugby union#Maul|maul]].

When a player anywhere in the playing area kicks indirectly into [[Touch (rugby)|touch]] so that the ball first bounces in the field of play, the throw-in is taken where the ball went into touch.<ref name="WRlaw19">{{cite web |url=http://laws.worldrugby.org/downloads/World_Rugby_Laws_2015_EN.pdf |title=Law 19 Touch and Lineout |publisher=[[World Rugby]] |accessdate=28 September 2015 |pages=117–137 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216025124/http://laws.worldrugby.org/downloads/World_Rugby_Laws_2015_EN.pdf |archivedate=16 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> If the player kicks directly into touch (i.e. without bouncing in-field first) from within one's own 22-metre line, the lineout is taken by the opposition where the ball went into touch, but if the ball is kicked into touch directly by a player outside the 22-metre line, the lineout is taken level to where the kick was taken.<ref name="WRlaw19"/>

===Breakdowns===
[[File:Schoolkids doing a rugby tackle.jpg|thumb|right|180px|A rugby tackle: tackles must be below the neck with the aim of impeding or grounding the player with the ball|alt=A child running away from camera in green and black hooped rugby jersey is in the process of being tackled around the hips and legs by an opponent]]
The aim of the defending side is to stop the player with the ball, either by bringing them to ground (a tackle, which is frequently followed by a ruck) or by contesting for possession with the ball-carrier on their feet (a maul). Such a circumstance is called a breakdown and each is governed by a specific law.

'''Tackling'''

A player may tackle an opposing player who has the ball by holding them while bringing them to ground. Tacklers cannot tackle above the shoulder (the neck and head are out of bounds),<ref name="10.4e">{{cite web |url=http://www.irblaws.com/index.php?law=10 |title=Law 10 Foul play |page=10.4(e) |publisher=[[International Rugby Board|IRB]] |accessdate=26 April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022230153/http://www.irblaws.com/index.php?law=10 |archive-date=22 October 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and the tackler has to attempt to wrap their arms around the player being tackled to complete the tackle. It is illegal to push, shoulder-charge, or to trip a player using feet or legs, but hands may be used (this being referred to as a tap-tackle or [[Ankle tap|ankle-tap]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.irblaws.com/index.php?law=10 |title=Law 10 Foul play |page=10.4(d) |publisher=[[International Rugby Board|IRB]] |accessdate=27 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209111927/http://www.irblaws.com/index.php?law=10 |archive-date=9 February 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.irblaws.com/index.php?law=10 |title=Law 10 Foul play |page=10.4(g) |publisher=[[International Rugby Board|IRB]] |accessdate=27 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209111927/http://www.irblaws.com/index.php?law=10 |archive-date=9 February 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Tacklers may not tackle an opponent who has jumped to catch a ball until the player has landed.<ref name="10.4e"/>

'''Rucking and Mauling'''

Mauls occur after a player with the ball has come into contact with an opponent but the handler remains on his feet; once any combination of at least three players have bound themselves a maul has been set.<ref name="Glossary"/> A ruck is similar to the maul, but in this case the ball has gone to ground with at least three attacking players binding themselves on the ground in an attempt to secure the ball.<ref name="Glossary"/>

===Set pieces===

====Lineout====

When the ball leaves the side of the field, a [[line-out (rugby union)|line-out]] is awarded against the team which last touched the ball.<ref name="irblaws19">{{cite web |url=http://www.irblaws.com/index.php?law=19 |title=Law 19 Touch and Lineout |publisher=[[International Rugby Board|IRB]] |accessdate=27 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209104345/http://www.irblaws.com/index.php?law=19 |archive-date=9 February 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Forward players from each team line up a metre apart, perpendicular to the touchline and between 5 m and 15 m from the touchline.<ref name="irblaws19"/> The ball is thrown from the touchline down the centre of the lines of forwards by a player (usually the [[hooker (rugby union)|hooker]]) from the team that did not play the ball into touch.<ref name="irblaws19"/> The exception to this is when the ball went out from a penalty, in which case the side who gained the penalty throws the ball in.<ref name="irblaws19"/>

A team may also opt for a scrum if awarded a penalty.<ref name="WRlaw20"/>

A scrum is formed by the eight forwards from each team binding together in three rows.<ref name="WRlaw20"/> The front row consists of the two props (loosehead and tighthead) either side of the hooker.<ref name="WRlaw20"/> The second row consists of two locks and the two flankers.

Common offences include tackling above the shoulders, collapsing a [[Scrum (rugby union)|scrum]], ruck or maul, not releasing the ball when on the ground, or being offside.<ref name="WRLaw10">{{cite web |url=http://laws.worldrugby.org/downloads/World_Rugby_Laws_2015_EN.pdf |title=Law 10: Foul Play |work=[[World Rugby]] |format=PDF |pages=66–74 |accessdate=28 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216025124/http://laws.worldrugby.org/downloads/World_Rugby_Laws_2015_EN.pdf |archivedate=16 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The non-offending team has a number of options when awarded a penalty: a "tap" kick, when the ball is kicked a very short distance from hand, allowing the kicker to regather the ball and run with it; a punt, when the ball is kicked a long distance from hand, for field position; a place-kick, when the kicker will attempt to score a goal; or a scrum.<ref name="WRLaw10"/> Players may be sent off (signalled by a [[Red card (sports)|red card]]) or temporarily suspended ("sin-binned") for ten minutes ([[Yellow card (sport)|yellow card]]) for foul play or repeated infringements, and may not be replaced.<ref name="WRLaw10"/>

Occasionally, infringements are not caught by the referee during the match and these may be "cited" by the [[citing commissioner]] after the match and have punishments (usually suspension for a number of weeks) imposed on the infringing player.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ercrugby.com/eng/heinekencup/rules/index.php |title=European Club Rugby: Key Tournament Rules |work=ercrugby.com |accessdate=24 October 2011}}</ref>

===Replacements and substitutions===
During the match, players may be replaced (for injury) or substituted (for tactical reasons).<ref name="Law3"/> A player who has been replaced may not rejoin play unless he was temporarily replaced to have bleeding controlled; a player who has been substituted may return temporarily, to replace a player who has a blood injury or has suffered a concussion, or permanently, if he is replacing a front-row forward.<ref name="Law3"/> In international matches, eight replacements are allowed; in domestic or cross-border tournaments, at the discretion of the responsible national union(s), the number of replacements may be nominated to a maximum of eight, of whom three must be sufficiently trained and experienced to provide cover for the three front row positions.<ref name="Law3"/><ref name="Uncontested">{{cite web|url=http://www.irb.com/newsmedia/mediazone/pressrelease/newsid=2033086.html#irb+acts+uncontested+scrums |title=IRB acts on uncontested scrums |publisher=[[World Rugby|International Rugby Board]] |date=19 August 2009 |accessdate=23 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822203000/http://www.irb.com/newsmedia/mediazone/pressrelease/newsid=2033086.html |archivedate=22 August 2009 }}</ref>

Prior to 2016, all substitutions, no matter the cause, counted against the limit during a match. In 2016, [[World Rugby]] changed the law so that substitutions made to replace a player deemed unable to continue due to foul play by the opposition would no longer count against the match limit. This change was introduced in January of that year in the Southern Hemisphere and June in the Northern Hemisphere.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/rugby/story/_/id/15885158/world-rugby-introduces-new-rules-stop-simulation |title=World Rugby introduces new rules to stop simulation |publisher=[[ESPN (UK)]] |date=1 June 2016 |accessdate=4 June 2016}}</ref>

Although the exact date of arrival of [[rugby union in Trinidad and Tobago]] is unknown, their first club Northern RFC was formed in 1923, a national team was playing by 1927 and due to a cancelled tour to [[British Guiana]] in 1933, switched their venue to [[Rugby union in Barbados|Barbados]]; introducing rugby to the island.<ref>{{Harvnb|Godwin|Rhys|1981|p=160}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Godwin|Rhys|1981|p=43}}</ref> Other Atlantic countries to play rugby union include [[Rugby union in Jamaica|Jamaica]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irb.com/unions/union=11000064/index.html |title=Jamaica |work=[[World Rugby|IRB]] |accessdate=6 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928002800/http://www.irb.com/unions/union=11000064/index.html |archivedate=28 September 2011 }}</ref> and [[Rugby union in Bermuda|Bermuda]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irb.com/unions/union=11000040/index.html |title=Bermuda |work=[[World Rugby|IRB]] |accessdate=6 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110915192248/http://www.irb.com/unions/union=11000040/index.html |archivedate=15 September 2011 }}</ref>

===Europe===
[[File:Germany vs Belgium rugby match.jpg|thumb|Germany playing [[Belgium national rugby union team|Belgium]]]]
The growth of rugby union in Europe outside the 6 Nations countries in terms of playing numbers has been sporadic. Historically, British and Irish home teams played the Southern Hemisphere teams of Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, as well as France. The rest of Europe were let to play amongst themselves. During a period when it had been isolated by the British and Irish Unions, France, lacking international competition, became the only European team from the top tier to regularly play the other European countries; mainly [[Rugby union in Belgium|Belgium]], the [[Rugby union in the Netherlands|Netherlands]], [[Rugby union in Germany|Germany]], [[Rugby union in Spain|Spain]], [[Rugby union in Romania|Romania]], [[Rugby union in Poland|Poland]], [[Rugby union in Italy|Italy]] and [[Rugby union in Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia]].<ref name="FIRA"/><ref>{{cite book |last=Dine |first=Philip |title=French Rugby Football |year=2001 |pages=79–94|publisher=Berg |location=Oxford |isbn=1-85973-327-1}}</ref> In 1934, instigated by the [[French Rugby Federation]], FIRA (Fédération Internationale de Rugby Amateur) was formed to organise rugby union outside the authority of the IRFB.<ref name="FIRA"/> The founding members were {{runion|ITA}}, {{runion|ROM}}, {{runion|NLD}}, {{runion|POR}}, {{runion|CSK}}, and {{runion|SWE}}.

Other European rugby playing nations of note include [[Rugby union in Russia|Russia]], whose first officially recorded match is marked by an encounter between Dynamo Moscow and the Moscow Institute of Physical Education in 1933.<ref>{{Harvnb|Godwin|Rhys|1981|p=148}}</ref> [[Rugby union in Portugal]] also took hold between the First and Second World Wars, with a Portuguese National XV set up in 1922 and an official championship started in 1927.<ref>{{Harvnb|Godwin|Rhys|1981|p=130}}</ref>

In 1999, FIRA agreed to place itself under the auspices of the IRB, transforming itself into a strictly European organising body. Accordingly, it changed its name to FIRA–AER (Fédération Internationale de Rugby Amateur – Association Européenne de Rugby). It adopted its current name of [[Rugby Europe]] in 2014.

===South America===

===Asia===
{{main|Rugby union in Asia}}
Many Asian countries have a tradition of playing rugby dating from the British Empire. [[Rugby union in India|India]] began playing rugby in the early 1870s, the [[Calcutta Football Club]] forming in 1873. However, with the departure of a local British army regiment, interest in rugby diminished in the area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofBritain/The-Calcutta-Cup/|title=The History of the Calcutta Cup|publisher=}}</ref> In 1878, The Calcutta Football Club was disbanded, and rugby in India faltered.<ref>{{Harvnb|Godwin|Rhys|1981|p=92}}</ref> [[Rugby union in Sri Lanka|Sri Lanka]] claims to have founded their union in 1878, and although little official information from the period is available, the team won the All-India cup in Madras in 1920.<ref>{{Harvnb|Godwin|Rhys|1981|p=152}}</ref> The first recorded match in [[Rugby union in Malaysia|Malaysia]] was in 1892, but the first confirmation of rugby is the existence of the ''HMS Malaya Cup'' which was first presented in 1922 and is still awarded to the winners of the Malay sevens.<ref>{{Harvnb|Godwin|Rhys|1981|pp=112–113}}</ref>

Rugby in the Middle East and the Gulf States has its history in the 1950s, with clubs formed by British and French Services stationed in the region after the Second World War.<ref>{{Harvnb|Godwin|Rhys|1981|p=42}}</ref> When these servicemen left, the clubs and teams were kept alive by young professionals, mostly Europeans, working in these countries.

===Africa===
In 1875, rugby was introduced to [[Rugby union in South Africa|South Africa]] by British soldiers garrisoned in Cape Town.<ref name="Godwin11"/> During the late 19th and early 20th century, the sport in Africa was spread by settlers and colonials who often adopted a "whites-only" policy to playing the game.

The Rugby Championship is the Southern Hemisphere's annual international series for that region's top national teams.

==Variants==
{{main|Rugby sevens}}
[[File:Spielszene BK.jpg|thumb|[[Beach rugby]] match|alt=On a sunlit beach two teams of players, one in yellow the other in blue, play a form of rugby; the central yellow player runs forward clutching the ball with one hand, close to his chest.]]

The game of rugby union has spawned several variants of the full-contact, 15-a-side code. The two more common differences applied to the variants of the sport lie in either fewer players or reduced player contact. Of the variants, the oldest is [[Rugby sevens]] (7s, or VIIs), a fast-paced variant which originated in [[Melrose, Scotland|Melrose]], Scotland in 1883. In rugby sevens, there are only seven players per side, and each half is normally seven minutes.

Major tournaments include the [[Hong Kong Sevens]] and [[Dubai Sevens]], both held in areas not normally associated with the highest levels of the 15-a-side game.

[[File:Tom Wills 1857.jpg|thumb|When codifying [[Australian rules football]] in 1859, [[Tom Wills]] drew inspiration from an early version of rugby he learnt at Rugby School.]]
[[Rugby league]] was formed as an administrative break from the English union before changing its laws, becoming a code in its own right. The two sports continue to influence each other to this day.
