Players may use any body part with the exception of arms and hands – their head, feet, knees, back, and depending on the rules, elbows to keep the ball aloft. The ball, known as a ''mari'', is made of deerskin with the hair facing inside and the hide on the outside. The ball is stuffed with barley grains to give it shape. When the hide has set in this shape, the grains are removed from the ball, and it is then sewn together using the skin of a horse. The one who kicks the ball is called a ''mariashi.'' A good mariashi makes it easy for the receiver to control the mari, and serves it with a soft touch to make it easy to keep the mari in the air.

Kemari is played on a flat ground, about 6–7 meters squared.<ref name="hawaii"/> The uniforms that the players wear are reminiscent of the clothes of the [[Asuka age]] and include a crow hat. This type of clothing was called ''[[kariginu]]'' and it was fashionable at that time.
