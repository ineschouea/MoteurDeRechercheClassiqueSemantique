'''Miniten''' (a [[Portmanteau|portmanteau word]], derived from '''mini'''+'''ten'''nis) is a [[tennis]]-like game created by [[naturism|naturists]].<ref>{{Cite news | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/how-to-be-a-naturist-1591253.html | title = how to be a naturist  | date = 1995-07-13 | work = [[The Independent]] | accessdate = 2009-09-01 | location=London | first=Sarah | last=Edghill}}</ref>    It was devised in the 1930s,<ref>''Miniten: Rules of the Game'', Wolfbait Books. 2017</ref> in order to provide a suitable game for naturist clubs which often lacked sufficient land to create full-sized tennis courts. Mr R. Douglas Ogden, a Manchester-based businessman with an interest in sporting activities drew up the original rules.<ref>''Miniten: Rules of the Game'', Wolfbait Books. 2017</ref>

The rules and scoring are similar to tennis and standard tennis balls are used, but the court is much smaller, and instead of [[racquet]]s, players use [[wood]]en bats known as ''thugs'', which are shaped like a box around the player's hand.<ref name=Local>{{Cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,,2091657,00.html | title = A stitch in time | date = 2007-05-31 | work = [[The Guardian]] | accessdate = 2009-08-27 | location=London}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news | url = http://www.smh.com.au/travel/nudists-descend-on-town-for-naturist-festival-20081230-771y.html | title = Nudists descend on town for naturist festival | date = 2008-12-30 | work = [[Sydney Morning Herald]] | accessdate = 2009-08-27}}</ref>
