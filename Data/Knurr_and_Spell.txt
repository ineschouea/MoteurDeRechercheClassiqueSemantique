==Etymology==
Knurr (from [[Middle English]]: ''knurre'', knot) refers to a hardwood or pottery<ref name=countryfile/> ball, as could be made from a knot of wood.  Spell (from {{lang-da|spil}}, spindle) is the stick of wood used to strike it.<ref name=eb/>

The game around [[Barnsley]] was known as "Potty Knocking".<ref>http://www.tradgames.org.uk/games/knur-spell.htm</ref>

==Equipment and play==
In Yorkshire it is played with a levered wooden trap, by means of which the knurr, about the size of a [[walnut]], is thrown into the air. In lancashire the knurr is suspended stationary from string. The knurr is struck by the player with the spell. The object of the game is to hit the knurr the greatest possible distance, either in one or several hits.<ref name=eb/> Each player competes as an individual, without interference, and any number can enter a competition.<ref name=nie/>

The spell is a bat consisting of two parts: a {{convert|4|ft}} long stick made of [[ash tree|ash]] or [[Oxandra lanceolata|lancewood;]]{{cn|date=January 2017}} and a pommel, a piece of very hard wood about {{convert|6|in}} long, {{convert|4|in}} wide and {{convert|1|in}} thick. This was swung in both hands, although shorter bats for one hand were sometimes used.<ref name=nie/><ref name=eb>{{EB1911|wstitle=Trap-ball}}</ref> A successful hit drives the ball about {{convert|200|yd}}. The stroke is made by a full swing round the head, not unlike a drive in [[golf]].<ref name=nie/>

Originally the ball was thrown into the air by striking a lever upon which it rested in the trap, but in the later development of the game a trap furnished with a spring was introduced, thus ensuring regularity in the height to which the knurr is tossed, somewhat after the manner of the [[shooting|shooter]]'s [[clay pigeon shooting|clay pigeon]]. By means of a [[Thumbscrew (fastener)|thumb screw]], the player can adjust the spring of the trap according to the velocity of release desired for the ball.<ref name=nie/><ref name=eb/>

On a large moor, and where the game is general, the ground is marked out with wooden pins driven in every {{convert|20|yd}}. In matches each player supplies their own knurrs and spells and has five rises of the ball to a game.<ref name=nie/>
