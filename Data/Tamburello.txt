'''Tamburello''' (named '''Tambass''' in [[Piedmont]]) is a [[game court|court game]] invented in the northern provinces of Italy during the 16th century. It is a modification of the ancient game of [[pallone#Pallone col bracciale|pallone col bracciale]], bearing the same general relation to it as [[Squash (sport)|Squash]] does to [[Rackets (sport)|Racquets]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=388}} Nowadays various forms of tamburello are popular in many nations of the world.

==Forms==

===Open===
This form is played at professional level in Italy where there are two varieties: the first kind taking place in a specialised sports venue called a [[sphaeristerium]] (''sferisterio'' in [[Italian language|Italian]]), with a lateral wall which permits the ball to rebound; the second kind being played in an open playing field without a lateral wall. A full-sized tamburello court, which need not be as true and even as that for pallone, is {{convert|90|to|100|yd|m}} long and half as wide, divided laterally through the middle by a line (''cordino'') into two equal spaces, the ''battuta'' and the ''rimessa''. Five players regularly form a side, each carrying in one hand an implement called a tamburello, resembling a [[tambourine]] (whence the name), which is a round frame of wood over which a cover of horsehide is tightly stretched. A rubber ball generally larger than a [[tennis ball]] is used. One of the players opens the service (''battuta''), which begins from a small square called the ''trampolino'', situated at one corner of the ''battuta'' but outside the court. The service must be over the middle line. The ball must then be hit from side to side over the line, the side failing to return it or sending it out of court losing a point. The game is scored like [[lawn tennis]], four points constituting a game, counting 15+15+10+10.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=388}}

===Indoor===
Indoor is practiced in an enclosed space such as a sports hall or a school gym on a small field and each team has maximum 8 players of which 3 simultaneously in the field. The ball in this case cannot be made of rubber, because too fast, and then using the tennis ball type depressurized. This is the tamburello's form more prevalent among the world: they play at least in 20 nations.

===Beach===
Beach is played on sand then obviously players hit the ball always at flight. Players stand on a field which is 24x12 metres split in half by a net high 2.15 m. They play in this manner: one player versus other one or two players versus other two like [[beach tennis]].

===Tambutennis===
In this form two players regularly stand in each side on a court split in half by a net like [[tennis]]. The ball, used in this game, is made with [[terrycloth]].
