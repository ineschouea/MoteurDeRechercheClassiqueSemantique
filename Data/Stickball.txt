'''Stickball''' is a [[street game]] related to [[baseball]], usually formed as a [[pick-up game]] played in large cities in the Northeastern United States, especially [[New York City]] and [[Philadelphia]]. The equipment consists of a [[broom]] handle and a rubber ball, typically a [[spaldeen]], pensy pinky, high bouncer or [[tennis ball]]. The rules come from baseball and are modified to fit the situation.  For example, a [[manhole cover]] may be used as a base, or buildings for foul lines. The game is a variation of [[Bat-and-ball games|stick and ball games]] dating back to at least the 1750s. This game was widely popular among youths during the 20th century until the 1980s.
