'''VX''', originally ''' Rock-It-Ball''', is a ball sport from the UK. It evolved in [[North Yorkshire]] ([[Great Britain]]) and was launched in February 2006 at the Youth Sport Trust's Sports Colleges Conference.  The sport was continually developed by the International Federation and in 2012 the Federation approved a move by the worldwide membership to rename the sport VX<ref>''Leeds Today'' 2012 television programme, Leeds Trinity College, Leeds August 8</ref> to cater for its international development.

VX has continued to be popular in schools in the UK <ref>''BBC Breakfast'' 2012 television programme, BBC, Harrogate November 3</ref> and is now being adopted by universities,<ref>Hill L.

It now has a foothold in 25 countries of which 15 have National Governing Bodies(NGBs).

VX is a totally gender-neutral sport.<ref>Hildreth P. and Mackenzie H. (2015) These Girls Can - and Do!

It is also accessible to players of all abilities. It is not an adaptation of any single sport however there are elements of several sports including [[dodgeball]], [[lacrosse]], [[basque pelota]] and [[hockey]].

==History==
The sport, originally known as Rock-It-Ball, is a ball sport which originated from the UK. It evolved in [[North Yorkshire]] ([[Great Britain]]) and was officially launched at the [[Youth Sport Trust]]'s Sports Colleges Conference in February 2006.

Rock-It-Ball spread through schools in the UK. It featured on four of the Youth Sport Trust’s programmes, began to be played regularly in 17 countries,<ref>Government Business (2010): Rock-It-Ball - the Fastest Growing Sport in the World. ''Government Business''. Volume 17, Number 8. pp. 62–63</ref> and saw the establishment of an international federation and eleven national governing bodies<ref>Nie? P. (2011): ''Rock-It-Ball - Gra Zespo?owa z Elementami Edukacji Olimpijskiej''. Unpublished Dissertation, Poznan University, 2011</ref>

Over time the international administrative body had taken the original game and further developed and extended it, setting up a full sports infrastructure. In 2012, in order to cater for the international growth, the sport was rebranded by the international community to VX.  All the clubs and NGBs followed suit and now all leagues, tournaments and international competitions are under the VX banner.

In August 2017 VX gained international recognition as a sport at the General Assembly of the Sport Recognised Association.

==Rules==
VX is played by two teams of five players.  The court is roughly the size of a sports hall with four badminton courts.  In the USA, basketball courts are used.  Each player uses a VstiX.  This is made up of a control bar and a thrower/catcher at each end.  Players are not restricted to a certain area but can go anywhere on court.  They must dribble by rock-ing the ball between the two ends, or by using one end of the VstiX to bounce the ball on the floor. Five balls are in play.  One point is scored by hitting an opponent with the ball between the shoulders and the feet. Three points are scored by catching an opponent's thrown ball.  When a player is hit (s)he must stand still, raise a hand and look to the referee.  The referee records the point and tells the player to play on. The referee is assisted by two umpires positioned on the opposite side of the court.  The role of the umpires is simply to look for infringements.  All infringements incur a three-point penalty.  Violence results in ejection from the game and disciplinary action.  Examples of infringements are:

* A player fails to acknowledge a strike.
* Fishing (this refers to picking up a ball while waiting to play on after being hit)
* Travelling, i.e. not dribbling.  A player can take two steps and then must dribble.  
* Striking.  A player is not allowed to strike either the ball or another player with the VstiX.
* Illegal bodily contact - for example deliberately barging into an opponent.
* Knocking the ball out of an opponent’s VstiX.
* Swearing

Formal matches consists of four quarters each of which lasts four minutes.

==Versions==
As part of the development of VX, the International Federation introduced Singles (V2), a 1v1v1 (V3) version and Doubles (V4) 	
* V2 is played by two players on a squash court with three balls. This version is possibly the most intense of the official versions. A game lasts for two halves of four minutes each.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bushell|first=Mike|title=Bushell's Best Bits|year=2013|publisher=John Blake|location=London|isbn=978-1-78219-012-7|pages=95}}</ref>
* V3 is also a singles version played on a squash court, however it is played by three players using four balls.  V3 is played on the basis of ‘every man for himself.’ The winner is the player who concedes the least number of points. A game lasts for two halves of four minutes each.
* V4 is also played on a squash court and is played 2v2 with four balls. A game lasts for two halves of four minutes each.<ref>''Skizzy'' 2013 television programme, Uganda TV, Kampala February</ref>	 
	
The new versions were created by the International Federation to develop the sport and provide individuals with an opportunity to set up clubs more easily.

The International Federation was established in December 2006 but changed its name to Global VX when the sport was rebranded in 2012. Global VX administers the sport on a global basis, assists with the establishment and running of NGBs <ref>VX: Spreading Like Bushfire (2014, Jan 1)''New Vision'' p37</ref><ref>''Game On'' 2012 television programme, Urban TV, Kampala December 27</ref> and organises international competition.  Global VX also runs the annual rules committee which takes place every January.

Global VX also has an awards programme.  The annual 'Executive' Awards recognise the work of volunteers in the sport.  'The Person of the Year' Award is awarded to an outstanding volunteer who has done exceptional work to promote and develop the sport.  The 'Person of the Year' and the Executive Awards are announced annually on Dec 31st

'''2011:''' Person of the Year: Matti Chasan Bergstein (Denmark) <br />
'''2012:''' The first Person of the Year since the sport was rebranded: VX Uganda.  Unusually, the award did not go to one individual but was presented to VX Uganda as a body to recognise the work and effort that had been made by several people to grow the sport in Africa <br />

==Hall of Fame==
Any member affiliated to Global VX (e.g. player, coach, administrator) can nominate any other affiliated member who they consider to have made an outstanding contribution to the sport. Any nominee with three nominations passes to the next stage for voting by the committee. The Hall of Fame Awards generally takes place every two years. In 2010 the voting committee felt unable to differentiate between the 3 nominees who reached the voting stage and so, as an exception, voted to induct all three.
In 2008 the founders of the original sport (Paul Hildreth, Paul Law, Bob Eldridge) were honoured by inducting them into the newly established Hall of Fame. 
*2008: Tom Hildreth, Craig Buttery
*2010: Carl Alsop, Graeme Wood, Ian Crosby
*2015: Helen Mackenzie, James Hasindihe

==Legends==
The 'Legends' Award and Gallery is reserved for players who have reached an outstanding level of achievement. This award was instigated in 2012 as a direct result of the achievements of Scotland's Scott MacMichael and is not intended to be an annual honour.
*2012: Scott MacMichael (Scotland)
*2013: Tom Hildreth (England)

'''VX''', originally ''' Rock-It-Ball''', is a ball sport from the UK. It evolved in [[North Yorkshire]] ([[Great Britain]]) and was launched in February 2006 at the Youth Sport Trust's Sports Colleges Conference.  The sport was continually developed by the International Federation and in 2012 the Federation approved a move by the worldwide membership to rename the sport VX<ref>''Leeds Today'' 2012 television programme, Leeds Trinity College, Leeds August 8</ref> to cater for its international development.

VX has continued to be popular in schools in the UK <ref>''BBC Breakfast'' 2012 television programme, BBC, Harrogate November 3</ref> and is now being adopted by universities,<ref>Hill L.

It now has a foothold in 25 countries of which 15 have National Governing Bodies(NGBs).

VX is a totally gender-neutral sport.<ref>Hildreth P. and Mackenzie H. (2015) These Girls Can - and Do!

It is also accessible to players of all abilities. It is not an adaptation of any single sport however there are elements of several sports including [[dodgeball]], [[lacrosse]], [[basque pelota]] and [[hockey]].

==History==
The sport, originally known as Rock-It-Ball, is a ball sport which originated from the UK. It evolved in [[North Yorkshire]] ([[Great Britain]]) and was officially launched at the [[Youth Sport Trust]]'s Sports Colleges Conference in February 2006.

Rock-It-Ball spread through schools in the UK. It featured on four of the Youth Sport Trust’s programmes, began to be played regularly in 17 countries,<ref>Government Business (2010): Rock-It-Ball - the Fastest Growing Sport in the World. ''Government Business''. Volume 17, Number 8. pp. 62–63</ref> and saw the establishment of an international federation and eleven national governing bodies<ref>Nie? P. (2011): ''Rock-It-Ball - Gra Zespo?owa z Elementami Edukacji Olimpijskiej''. Unpublished Dissertation, Poznan University, 2011</ref>

Over time the international administrative body had taken the original game and further developed and extended it, setting up a full sports infrastructure. In 2012, in order to cater for the international growth, the sport was rebranded by the international community to VX.  All the clubs and NGBs followed suit and now all leagues, tournaments and international competitions are under the VX banner.

In August 2017 VX gained international recognition as a sport at the General Assembly of the Sport Recognised Association.

==Rules==
VX is played by two teams of five players.  The court is roughly the size of a sports hall with four badminton courts.  In the USA, basketball courts are used.  Each player uses a VstiX.  This is made up of a control bar and a thrower/catcher at each end.  Players are not restricted to a certain area but can go anywhere on court.  They must dribble by rock-ing the ball between the two ends, or by using one end of the VstiX to bounce the ball on the floor. Five balls are in play.  One point is scored by hitting an opponent with the ball between the shoulders and the feet. Three points are scored by catching an opponent's thrown ball.  When a player is hit (s)he must stand still, raise a hand and look to the referee.  The referee records the point and tells the player to play on. The referee is assisted by two umpires positioned on the opposite side of the court.  The role of the umpires is simply to look for infringements.  All infringements incur a three-point penalty.  Violence results in ejection from the game and disciplinary action.  Examples of infringements are:

* A player fails to acknowledge a strike.
* Fishing (this refers to picking up a ball while waiting to play on after being hit)
* Travelling, i.e. not dribbling.  A player can take two steps and then must dribble.  
* Striking.  A player is not allowed to strike either the ball or another player with the VstiX.
* Illegal bodily contact - for example deliberately barging into an opponent.
* Knocking the ball out of an opponent’s VstiX.
* Swearing

Formal matches consists of four quarters each of which lasts four minutes.

==Versions==
As part of the development of VX, the International Federation introduced Singles (V2), a 1v1v1 (V3) version and Doubles (V4) 	
* V2 is played by two players on a squash court with three balls. This version is possibly the most intense of the official versions. A game lasts for two halves of four minutes each.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bushell|first=Mike|title=Bushell's Best Bits|year=2013|publisher=John Blake|location=London|isbn=978-1-78219-012-7|pages=95}}</ref>
* V3 is also a singles version played on a squash court, however it is played by three players using four balls.  V3 is played on the basis of ‘every man for himself.’ The winner is the player who concedes the least number of points. A game lasts for two halves of four minutes each.
* V4 is also played on a squash court and is played 2v2 with four balls. A game lasts for two halves of four minutes each.<ref>''Skizzy'' 2013 television programme, Uganda TV, Kampala February</ref>	 
	
The new versions were created by the International Federation to develop the sport and provide individuals with an opportunity to set up clubs more easily.

==Federation==
The International Federation was established in December 2006 but changed its name to Global VX when the sport was rebranded in 2012. Global VX administers the sport on a global basis, assists with the establishment and running of NGBs <ref>VX: Spreading Like Bushfire (2014, Jan 1)''New Vision'' p37</ref><ref>''Game On'' 2012 television programme, Urban TV, Kampala December 27</ref> and organises international competition.  Global VX also runs the annual rules committee which takes place every January.

Global VX also has an awards programme.  The annual 'Executive' Awards recognise the work of volunteers in the sport.  'The Person of the Year' Award is awarded to an outstanding volunteer who has done exceptional work to promote and develop the sport.  The 'Person of the Year' and the Executive Awards are announced annually on Dec 31st

'''2010:''' Person of the Year: Conrad Broughton (England) <br />
'''2011:''' Person of the Year: Matti Chasan Bergstein (Denmark) <br />
'''2012:''' The first Person of the Year since the sport was rebranded: VX Uganda.  Unusually, the award did not go to one individual but was presented to VX Uganda as a body to recognise the work and effort that had been made by several people to grow the sport in Africa <br />

==Hall of Fame==
Any member affiliated to Global VX (e.g. player, coach, administrator) can nominate any other affiliated member who they consider to have made an outstanding contribution to the sport. Any nominee with three nominations passes to the next stage for voting by the committee. The Hall of Fame Awards generally takes place every two years. In 2010 the voting committee felt unable to differentiate between the 3 nominees who reached the voting stage and so, as an exception, voted to induct all three.
In 2008 the founders of the original sport (Paul Hildreth, Paul Law, Bob Eldridge) were honoured by inducting them into the newly established Hall of Fame. 
*2008: Tom Hildreth, Craig Buttery
*2010: Carl Alsop, Graeme Wood, Ian Crosby
*2015: Helen Mackenzie, James Hasindihe

==Legends==
The 'Legends' Award and Gallery is reserved for players who have reached an outstanding level of achievement. This award was instigated in 2012 as a direct result of the achievements of Scotland's Scott MacMichael and is not intended to be an annual honour.
*2012: Scott MacMichael (Scotland)
*2013: Tom Hildreth (England)

'''VX''', originally ''' Rock-It-Ball''', is a ball sport from the UK. It evolved in [[North Yorkshire]] ([[Great Britain]]) and was launched in February 2006 at the Youth Sport Trust's Sports Colleges Conference.  The sport was continually developed by the International Federation and in 2012 the Federation approved a move by the worldwide membership to rename the sport VX<ref>''Leeds Today'' 2012 television programme, Leeds Trinity College, Leeds August 8</ref> to cater for its international development.

VX has continued to be popular in schools in the UK <ref>''BBC Breakfast'' 2012 television programme, BBC, Harrogate November 3</ref> and is now being adopted by universities,<ref>Hill L.

It now has a foothold in 25 countries of which 15 have National Governing Bodies(NGBs).

VX is a totally gender-neutral sport.<ref>Hildreth P. and Mackenzie H. (2015) These Girls Can - and Do!

It is also accessible to players of all abilities. It is not an adaptation of any single sport however there are elements of several sports including [[dodgeball]], [[lacrosse]], [[basque pelota]] and [[hockey]].

==History==
The sport, originally known as Rock-It-Ball, is a ball sport which originated from the UK. It evolved in [[North Yorkshire]] ([[Great Britain]]) and was officially launched at the [[Youth Sport Trust]]'s Sports Colleges Conference in February 2006.

Rock-It-Ball spread through schools in the UK. It featured on four of the Youth Sport Trust’s programmes, began to be played regularly in 17 countries,<ref>Government Business (2010): Rock-It-Ball - the Fastest Growing Sport in the World. ''Government Business''. Volume 17, Number 8. pp. 62–63</ref> and saw the establishment of an international federation and eleven national governing bodies<ref>Nie? P. (2011): ''Rock-It-Ball - Gra Zespo?owa z Elementami Edukacji Olimpijskiej''. Unpublished Dissertation, Poznan University, 2011</ref>

Over time the international administrative body had taken the original game and further developed and extended it, setting up a full sports infrastructure. In 2012, in order to cater for the international growth, the sport was rebranded by the international community to VX.  All the clubs and NGBs followed suit and now all leagues, tournaments and international competitions are under the VX banner.

In August 2017 VX gained international recognition as a sport at the General Assembly of the Sport Recognised Association.

==Rules==
VX is played by two teams of five players.  The court is roughly the size of a sports hall with four badminton courts.  In the USA, basketball courts are used.  Each player uses a VstiX.  This is made up of a control bar and a thrower/catcher at each end.  Players are not restricted to a certain area but can go anywhere on court.  They must dribble by rock-ing the ball between the two ends, or by using one end of the VstiX to bounce the ball on the floor. Five balls are in play.  One point is scored by hitting an opponent with the ball between the shoulders and the feet. Three points are scored by catching an opponent's thrown ball.  When a player is hit (s)he must stand still, raise a hand and look to the referee.  The referee records the point and tells the player to play on. The referee is assisted by two umpires positioned on the opposite side of the court.  The role of the umpires is simply to look for infringements.  All infringements incur a three-point penalty.  Violence results in ejection from the game and disciplinary action.  Examples of infringements are:

* A player fails to acknowledge a strike.
* Fishing (this refers to picking up a ball while waiting to play on after being hit)
* Travelling, i.e. not dribbling.  A player can take two steps and then must dribble.  
* Striking.  A player is not allowed to strike either the ball or another player with the VstiX.
* Illegal bodily contact - for example deliberately barging into an opponent.
* Knocking the ball out of an opponent’s VstiX.
* Swearing

Formal matches consists of four quarters each of which lasts four minutes.

==Versions==
As part of the development of VX, the International Federation introduced Singles (V2), a 1v1v1 (V3) version and Doubles (V4) 	
* V2 is played by two players on a squash court with three balls. This version is possibly the most intense of the official versions. A game lasts for two halves of four minutes each.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bushell|first=Mike|title=Bushell's Best Bits|year=2013|publisher=John Blake|location=London|isbn=978-1-78219-012-7|pages=95}}</ref>
* V3 is also a singles version played on a squash court, however it is played by three players using four balls.  V3 is played on the basis of ‘every man for himself.’ The winner is the player who concedes the least number of points. A game lasts for two halves of four minutes each.
* V4 is also played on a squash court and is played 2v2 with four balls. A game lasts for two halves of four minutes each.<ref>''Skizzy'' 2013 television programme, Uganda TV, Kampala February</ref>	 
	
The new versions were created by the International Federation to develop the sport and provide individuals with an opportunity to set up clubs more easily.

==Federation==
The International Federation was established in December 2006 but changed its name to Global VX when the sport was rebranded in 2012. Global VX administers the sport on a global basis, assists with the establishment and running of NGBs <ref>VX: Spreading Like Bushfire (2014, Jan 1)''New Vision'' p37</ref><ref>''Game On'' 2012 television programme, Urban TV, Kampala December 27</ref> and organises international competition.  Global VX also runs the annual rules committee which takes place every January.

Global VX also has an awards programme.  The annual 'Executive' Awards recognise the work of volunteers in the sport.  'The Person of the Year' Award is awarded to an outstanding volunteer who has done exceptional work to promote and develop the sport.  The 'Person of the Year' and the Executive Awards are announced annually on Dec 31st

'''2010:''' Person of the Year: Conrad Broughton (England) <br />
'''2011:''' Person of the Year: Matti Chasan Bergstein (Denmark) <br />
'''2012:''' The first Person of the Year since the sport was rebranded: VX Uganda.  Unusually, the award did not go to one individual but was presented to VX Uganda as a body to recognise the work and effort that had been made by several people to grow the sport in Africa <br />

==Hall of Fame==
Any member affiliated to Global VX (e.g. player, coach, administrator) can nominate any other affiliated member who they consider to have made an outstanding contribution to the sport. Any nominee with three nominations passes to the next stage for voting by the committee. The Hall of Fame Awards generally takes place every two years. In 2010 the voting committee felt unable to differentiate between the 3 nominees who reached the voting stage and so, as an exception, voted to induct all three.
In 2008 the founders of the original sport (Paul Hildreth, Paul Law, Bob Eldridge) were honoured by inducting them into the newly established Hall of Fame. 
*2008: Tom Hildreth, Craig Buttery
*2010: Carl Alsop, Graeme Wood, Ian Crosby
*2015: Helen Mackenzie, James Hasindihe

==Legends==
The 'Legends' Award and Gallery is reserved for players who have reached an outstanding level of achievement. This award was instigated in 2012 as a direct result of the achievements of Scotland's Scott MacMichael and is not intended to be an annual honour.
*2012: Scott MacMichael (Scotland)
*2013: Tom Hildreth (England)
