'''Roller hockey''' (in [[British English]]), '''rink hockey''' (in [[American English]]) or '''quad hockey''' is a team sport that enjoys significant popularity in a number of Latin countries.

Two five-man teams (four skaters and one goalkeeper) try to drive the ball with their sticks into the opponents' goal. The ball can only be put in motion by a stick, not the skate, otherwise a foul will be stated. The game has two 25-minute halves, plus up to two 5-minute periods to settle ties with the clock stopping when the ball becomes dead.

Players – including the goalie – use [[quad skates]], whereas [[inline skates]] are used in [[inline hockey]]. Excessive contact between players is forbidden in rink hockey, unlike inline hockey.

[[Roller hockey at the 1992 Summer Olympics|Roller Hockey]] was a [[Demonstration sport|demonstration rollersport]] in the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in [[Barcelona]]. There have been 43 editions of the [[Roller Hockey World Cup]], with Latin countries dominating the sport since the 1940s: [[Spain national roller hockey team|Spain]] (17 World titles), [[Portugal national roller hockey team|Portugal]] (15 World titles), [[Argentina national roller hockey team|Argentina]] (5 World titles) and [[Italy men's national roller hockey team|Italy]] (4 World titles). Other countries, such as [[France national roller hockey team|France]], [[Brazil national roller hockey team|Brazil]], [[Germany national roller hockey team|Germany]], [[Switzerland national roller hockey team|Switzerland]], [[Andorra national roller hockey team|Andorra]] and [[England national roller hockey team|England]] are regular international competitors, but rarely overcome the traditional powers.

Roller Hockey is a very fast sport, which may create a problem for TV transmissions, and new rinks are built using blue or white pavement to make the ball more visible on TV.

== Name ==
Roller Hockey (Quad) was referred to as Hardball Hockey in the [[United States]] until November 2008 when the [[USOC]] adopted the sport's more common name, Rink Hockey. Other names for the sport include Hardball Roller Hockey, Ball Hockey, International Style Ball hockey, International hockey, Quad Hockey, Hockey, English Roller Hockey, Hockey Sobre Patines, Hockey pista, Hóquei em patins, Hockey Skids, Traditional Hockey, Cane Hockey, Rollhockey, Rolhockey, Hokej na koturaljkama, Rulleskøjtehockey and Rulluisuhoki.

== The rink ==
[[File:Campo hockey su pista.svg|thumb|right|a rink]]
The rink has usually a polished wooden surface, but any flat, non-abrasive and non-slippery material such as treated cement is acceptable. Likewise, it is allowed for rink owners to put advertisements in the playing area, as long as they don't interfere with ball or skate motion, which includes both physically (must be at exactly the same level as the remaining area) and visually (dark colours or any other pattern which can mask the ball).

It can have one out of three standard sizes (a minimum of 34x17 meters, an average of 40x20 and a maximum of 44x22) or any size between the minimum and maximum values that has a 2:1 size ratio with a 10% margin of error.

The rink has rounded corners (1 m radius) and is surrounded by a 1 m wall. The wall also has a wooden base 2&nbsp;cm wide and at least 20&nbsp;cm high. Behind the goals there is a 4 m high net, even if there are no stands (to avoid the ball bouncing back from a wall and hitting a player). If the ball hits the net, it's considered to be out of bounds.

The markings are simple. The halfway line divides the rink into halves, and 22 m  from the end wall an "anti-play" line is painted. The area is a 9 X 5.40 m rectangle, placed from 2.7 to 3.3 m ahead of the end table. It has a protection area for goalkeepers, a half-circle with 1.5 m radius. All markings are 8&nbsp;cm in width. The goal (painted in fluorescent orange) is 105&nbsp;cm high by 170&nbsp;cm wide. Inside the goal there is a thick net and a bar close to ground to trap the ball inside (before, two extra referees stayed behind the goal to judge goal decisions), and 92&nbsp;cm deep. While not attached to the ground, it is extremely heavy to prevent movement.

* The clothing is similar to that used in [[Association football]]&mdash;socks up to the knee, shorts and a shirt.
* Sticks are different for skaters and goalkeepers. They can be of any material approved by the World Skate (although wooden sticks are still most often used), with a minimum length of 90&nbsp;cm and maximum of 115&nbsp;cm. They cannot be wider than 5&nbsp;cm or weigh over 500 g.
* The ball is made of pressed [[Cork (material)|cork]], has a 23&nbsp;cm in circumference, and weighs 155 g.
* The skates must have two pairs of wheels, with a minimum diameter of 3&nbsp;cm. Players are allowed to use brakes in the front of the skate, with a diameter or larger side not larger than 5&nbsp;cm.
* Protective material includes shin guards, knee caps, jock strap and gloves. Specifications for helmets and elbow caps vary from federation to federation.
* Goalkeepers (or netminders) use protective padding on the torso (plus shoulders) (the maximum amount is being regulated, since, as in [[ice hockey]], many goalkeepers have been using massive protection to make them larger and broader), neck guard, large shin guards (not longer than 75&nbsp;cm), gloves protecting the whole forearm and a helmet with either a grid or unbreakable transparent material. Unlike the Roller Hockey (Inline) Goalie who uses a Catch Glove to catch the shot on goal, the Roller hockey (Quad) Goalie uses a flat batting glove that provides rebound characteristics when blocking a shot on goal.

'''Roller hockey''' (in [[British English]]), '''rink hockey''' (in [[American English]]) or '''quad hockey''' is a team sport that enjoys significant popularity in a number of Latin countries.

Two five-man teams (four skaters and one goalkeeper) try to drive the ball with their sticks into the opponents' goal. The ball can only be put in motion by a stick, not the skate, otherwise a foul will be stated. The game has two 25-minute halves, plus up to two 5-minute periods to settle ties with the clock stopping when the ball becomes dead.

Players – including the goalie – use [[quad skates]], whereas [[inline skates]] are used in [[inline hockey]]. Excessive contact between players is forbidden in rink hockey, unlike inline hockey.

[[Roller hockey at the 1992 Summer Olympics|Roller Hockey]] was a [[Demonstration sport|demonstration rollersport]] in the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in [[Barcelona]]. There have been 43 editions of the [[Roller Hockey World Cup]], with Latin countries dominating the sport since the 1940s: [[Spain national roller hockey team|Spain]] (17 World titles), [[Portugal national roller hockey team|Portugal]] (15 World titles), [[Argentina national roller hockey team|Argentina]] (5 World titles) and [[Italy men's national roller hockey team|Italy]] (4 World titles). Other countries, such as [[France national roller hockey team|France]], [[Brazil national roller hockey team|Brazil]], [[Germany national roller hockey team|Germany]], [[Switzerland national roller hockey team|Switzerland]], [[Andorra national roller hockey team|Andorra]] and [[England national roller hockey team|England]] are regular international competitors, but rarely overcome the traditional powers.

Roller Hockey is a very fast sport, which may create a problem for TV transmissions, and new rinks are built using blue or white pavement to make the ball more visible on TV.

== Name ==
Roller Hockey (Quad) was referred to as Hardball Hockey in the [[United States]] until November 2008 when the [[USOC]] adopted the sport's more common name, Rink Hockey. Other names for the sport include Hardball Roller Hockey, Ball Hockey, International Style Ball hockey, International hockey, Quad Hockey, Hockey, English Roller Hockey, Hockey Sobre Patines, Hockey pista, Hóquei em patins, Hockey Skids, Traditional Hockey, Cane Hockey, Rollhockey, Rolhockey, Hokej na koturaljkama, Rulleskøjtehockey and Rulluisuhoki.

== The rink ==
[[File:Campo hockey su pista.svg|thumb|right|a rink]]
The rink has usually a polished wooden surface, but any flat, non-abrasive and non-slippery material such as treated cement is acceptable. Likewise, it is allowed for rink owners to put advertisements in the playing area, as long as they don't interfere with ball or skate motion, which includes both physically (must be at exactly the same level as the remaining area) and visually (dark colours or any other pattern which can mask the ball).

It can have one out of three standard sizes (a minimum of 34x17 meters, an average of 40x20 and a maximum of 44x22) or any size between the minimum and maximum values that has a 2:1 size ratio with a 10% margin of error.

The rink has rounded corners (1 m radius) and is surrounded by a 1 m wall. The wall also has a wooden base 2&nbsp;cm wide and at least 20&nbsp;cm high. Behind the goals there is a 4 m high net, even if there are no stands (to avoid the ball bouncing back from a wall and hitting a player). If the ball hits the net, it's considered to be out of bounds.

The markings are simple. The halfway line divides the rink into halves, and 22 m  from the end wall an "anti-play" line is painted. The area is a 9 X 5.40 m rectangle, placed from 2.7 to 3.3 m ahead of the end table. It has a protection area for goalkeepers, a half-circle with 1.5 m radius. All markings are 8&nbsp;cm in width. The goal (painted in fluorescent orange) is 105&nbsp;cm high by 170&nbsp;cm wide. Inside the goal there is a thick net and a bar close to ground to trap the ball inside (before, two extra referees stayed behind the goal to judge goal decisions), and 92&nbsp;cm deep. While not attached to the ground, it is extremely heavy to prevent movement.

* The clothing is similar to that used in [[Association football]]&mdash;socks up to the knee, shorts and a shirt.
* Sticks are different for skaters and goalkeepers. They can be of any material approved by the World Skate (although wooden sticks are still most often used), with a minimum length of 90&nbsp;cm and maximum of 115&nbsp;cm. They cannot be wider than 5&nbsp;cm or weigh over 500 g.
* The ball is made of pressed [[Cork (material)|cork]], has a 23&nbsp;cm in circumference, and weighs 155 g.
* The skates must have two pairs of wheels, with a minimum diameter of 3&nbsp;cm. Players are allowed to use brakes in the front of the skate, with a diameter or larger side not larger than 5&nbsp;cm.
* Protective material includes shin guards, knee caps, jock strap and gloves. Specifications for helmets and elbow caps vary from federation to federation.
* Goalkeepers (or netminders) use protective padding on the torso (plus shoulders) (the maximum amount is being regulated, since, as in [[ice hockey]], many goalkeepers have been using massive protection to make them larger and broader), neck guard, large shin guards (not longer than 75&nbsp;cm), gloves protecting the whole forearm and a helmet with either a grid or unbreakable transparent material. Unlike the Roller Hockey (Inline) Goalie who uses a Catch Glove to catch the shot on goal, the Roller hockey (Quad) Goalie uses a flat batting glove that provides rebound characteristics when blocking a shot on goal.
