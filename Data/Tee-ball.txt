'''Tee-ball''' (also '''teeball''', '''tee ball''' or '''t-ball''') is a [[team sport]] based on and simplifying [[baseball]] and [[softball]]. It is intended as an introduction for children aged 4 to 6 to develop ball-game skills and have fun.

Despite the implication of some of the spellings of the game's name, the [[tee]] used in tee-ball is not T-shaped, but simply an upright, flexible shaft on a movable base.  The capitalized, spaced-apart name "Tee Ball" is a registered trademark in the US, by a church-affiliated Florida league, as is the abbreviated "T-Ball" (stylized "Sharky" in logos), by a national, non-profit, secular league.

==History==
The game's origins date back to at least the 1950s, with several people claiming to be the father of the game, and it appears to have been independently invented in several places. [[Albion, Michigan]] claims to be the earliest place of invention of the sport, in 1956, by Jerome Sacharski.<ref>[http://www.albionmich.com/history/histor_notebook/020428.shtml "T-Ball Invented in Albion"], Frank Passic, ''Morning Star'', April 28, 2002, pg. 5</ref>  Claude Lewis, director of the [[Warner Robins, Georgia]], Recreation Department, formed a tee-ball league in March 1958, in which 20 children played the first year.  Lewis designed rules for the new game and mailed the rule books out to rec departments all over the country and overseas.  Nevertheless, [[Starkville, Mississippi]] claims to have independently created tee-ball in their town in 1961.
