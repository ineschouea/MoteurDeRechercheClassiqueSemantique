[[File:Paerk1.JPG|thumb|A game of pärk]]
'''Pärk''' or '''Paerk''' is a [[game]], somewhat similar to a game of [[baseball]] but where the aim is to gain ground like in [[American football]], that has been played for centuries on the island of [[Gotland]] in [[Baltic Sea]]. The game is played with two teams of 7 people on a field that is {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide and that can vary in length. The players hit the ball with their hands or feet. The  paerk, or [[serve (tennis)|serve]] area, is marked off with wooden [[lath]]s and measures {{convert|2.1|×|0.7|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name=games>{{cite web|last1=Molin|first1=Maria|title=Stångaspelen för den oinvigde|trans-title=Stånga Games for the uninitiated|date=12 June 2015|url=http://www.gotland.net/se-och-gora/arkiv/stangaspelen-for-den-oinvigde/11142011|website=www.gotland.net|publisher=Gotlands Media AB|accessdate=24 June 2016}}</ref>
