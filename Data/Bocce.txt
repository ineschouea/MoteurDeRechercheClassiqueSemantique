==History==
{{Expand section|date=April 2019}}

==Rules and play==
Bocce is traditionally played on natural soil and asphalt courts {{convert|27.5|m}} in length and {{convert|2.5|to|4|m|ft}} wide.<ref>[http://www.boccevolo.com/about/ch1.html www.BocceVolo.com - Official Rules - Chapter 1 - Article 4 - Specifications of the Court]</ref>  Bocce balls can be made of [[metal]]<ref>[http://www.boccevolo.com/about/ch1.html www.BocceVolo.com - Official Rules - Chapter 1 - Article 1 - The Bowls]</ref> or various kinds of [[plastic]]. Unlike [[lawn bowls]], bocce balls are spherical and have no inbuilt bias.   
A game can be conducted between two players, or two teams of two, three, or four. A match is started by a randomly chosen side being given the opportunity to throw a smaller ball, the '''jack''' (called a ''{{lang|it|boccino}}'' ('little bocce') or ''{{lang|it|pallino}}'' ('bullet' or 'little ball') in Italian, depending on local custom), from one end of the court into a zone {{convert|5|m|ft}} in length, ending {{convert|2.5|m|ft}} from the far end of the court. If the first team misses twice, the other team is awarded the opportunity to place the jack anywhere they choose within the prescribed zone.<ref>[https://books.google.com.mt/books?id=WmKKCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA309&dq=razzett&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiWu47-neXNAhWrKsAKHYbfA1w4FBDoAQgvMAM#v=onepage&q=razzett&f=false Malta and Gozo].</ref>

The side that first attempted to place the jack is given the opportunity to bowl first. Once the first bowl has taken place, the other side has the opportunity to bowl. From then on, the side which does ''not'' have the ball closest to the jack has a chance to bowl, up until one side or the other has used their four balls. At that point, the other side bowls its remaining balls. The team with the closest ball to the jack is the only team that can score points in any frame. The scoring team receives one point for each of their balls that is closer to the jack than the closest ball of the other team. The length of a game varies by region but is typically from 7 to 13 points.<ref>[http://www.boccevolo.com/about/ch2.html www.BocceVolo.com - Official Rules - Chapter 2 - Article 8 - Points to be Made and the Duration of the Match]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com.mt/books?id=WmKKCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA309&dq=razzett&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiWu47-neXNAhWrKsAKHYbfA1w4FBDoAQgvMAM#v=onepage&q=razzett&f=false Malta and Gozo].</ref>

Players are permitted to throw the ball in the air using an underarm action. This is generally used to knock either the jack or another ball away to attain a more favorable position. Tactics can get quite complex when players have sufficient control over the ball to throw or roll it accurately.<ref>[https://books.google.com.mt/books?id=WmKKCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA309&dq=razzett&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiWu47-neXNAhWrKsAKHYbfA1w4FBDoAQgvMAM#v=onepage&q=razzett&f=false Malta and Gozo].</ref>

==Variants==
===Bocce volo===
{{main|Bocce volo}}
A variation called ''{{lang|it|bocce volo}}'' uses a metal ball, which is thrown overhand (palm down), after a run-up to the throwing line. In that latter respect, it is similar to the French boules game ''{{lang|fr|[[jeu provençal]]}}'' also known as ''{{lang|fr|boule lyonnaise}}''.  A French variant of the game is called ''{{lang|fr|[[pétanque]]}}'', and (lacking the run-up) is more similar in some respects to traditional ''{{lang|it|bocce}}''.<ref>Petanque vs. Bocce at [http://petanque-america.com/game.html Petanque America]</ref>

===Boccia===
{{main|Boccia}}
[[File:Australian Boccia team members.jpg|thumb|Australian boccia team members]]
Another development, for persons with disabilities, is called ''{{lang|it|boccia}}''. It is a shorter-range game, played with leather balls on an indoor, smooth surface. Boccia was first introduced to the Paralympics at the [[1984 Summer Paralympics|1984 New York/Stoke Mandeville Games]], and is one of the only two Paralympic sports that do not have an Olympic counterpart (the other being [[goalball]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.paralympic.org/boccia|title=Boccia |publisher=[[International Paralympic Committee]]|accessdate=2018-03-12}}</ref>

A variation called ''{{lang|it|bocce volo}}'' uses a metal ball, which is thrown overhand (palm down), after a run-up to the throwing line. In that latter respect, it is similar to the French boules game ''{{lang|fr|[[jeu provençal]]}}'' also known as ''{{lang|fr|boule lyonnaise}}''.  A French variant of the game is called ''{{lang|fr|[[pétanque]]}}'', and (lacking the run-up) is more similar in some respects to traditional ''{{lang|it|bocce}}''.<ref>Petanque vs. Bocce at [http://petanque-america.com/game.html Petanque America]</ref>

Another development, for persons with disabilities, is called ''{{lang|it|boccia}}''. It is a shorter-range game, played with leather balls on an indoor, smooth surface. Boccia was first introduced to the Paralympics at the [[1984 Summer Paralympics|1984 New York/Stoke Mandeville Games]], and is one of the only two Paralympic sports that do not have an Olympic counterpart (the other being [[goalball]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.paralympic.org/boccia|title=Boccia |publisher=[[International Paralympic Committee]]|accessdate=2018-03-12}}</ref>
