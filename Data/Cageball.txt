'''Cageball''' is a [[sport]] invented by the football coach [[Jörg Berger]], seeking a way to play [[football (soccer)|football (American soccer)]] despite bad winter conditions.

It is similar to traditional indoor football, although with some changes: as the name implies, one plays in a [[Cage (enclosure)|cage]]. Due to the enclosed environment, the game is faster and more dynamic, and putting greater emphasis on football technique.

== Playing field ==
Cageball is played on [[artificial turf]]. The playing field is usually 23x15 metres, but can vary somewhat due to hall constraints. The entire field is surrounded by a one-metre-high wall or fence, out of which extends a net for a further four metres upwards. This way, the ball is always in play, obsoleting all out-of-bound rules. Usually, a Cageball team consists of three field players and a goalkeeper, the latter which can also assume a "flying" role.

== Rules ==
Normal football rules apply when it comes to [[Foul (sports)|fouls]] and deliberate hand usage. Free kicks must be immediately carried out. The [[offside (sport)|offside]] is not observed, and there are no throw-ins or [[goal kick]]s.
