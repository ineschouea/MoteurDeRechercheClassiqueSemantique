'''Stoop ball''' (also spelled "stoopball") is a game that is played by throwing a ball against a [[urban stoop|stoop]] (stairs leading up to a building) on the pavement in front of a building.  Historically, it has been popular in [[Brooklyn]] and other [[inner cities]].  In [[Boston]], the game is known as "Up-Against." In [[Chicago]], the game is known as "[[Pinners]]." The game is also known as "Off the Point".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.streetplay.com/wiki/index.php?title=Off_the_wall|title=Stoopball at|date=September 21, 2006|publisher=Streetplay.com|accessdate=March 18, 2010}}</ref>  It first became popular after [[World War II]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Schupak |first=Marty |url=http://www.webball.com/cms/page1441.cfm |title=Stoop Ball on |publisher=Webball.com |date= |accessdate=March 18, 2010}}</ref>

==Rules==
Stoop ball is a pickup neighborhood game played on the stairs of a residential dwelling by a minimum of two players. The rules <ref>{{cite web|url=http://stoopball.ning.com/profiles/blog/show?id=2770758%3ABlogPost%3A2001&commentId=2770758%3AComment%3A2141&xg_source=activity |title=Official Rules – Stoopball League of America |publisher=Stoopball.ning.com |date= |accessdate=March 18, 2010}} </ref> are based loosely on [[baseball]]. The object of the game is to score the most runs in 9 [[innings]].

One player is the "batter" and the other players the "fielders". The batter stands immediately in front of the stairs while the fielders stand behind the batter across the sidewalk on to the street.  The "batter" throws a pink rubber ball (either a "[[spaldeen]]" or "[[pensie pinkie]]") at the stoop.  The ball flies back towards the fielders, who are also facing the stoop.  The objective is to hit the ball at such an angle and velocity so that it bounces back in the air as far as possible over the heads of the fielders, therefore registering bigger hits.  The number of bases registered by a hit is determined by the distance traveled by the ball before it is fielded, unless the ball is caught on the fly resulting in an out.

The Stoopball League of America holds its annual world championships every July in Clinton, Wisconsin.
