The striking surface of the glove (facing down in this photo) is studded with nails driven into the glove]]'''''Pelota mixteca''''' ("[[Mixtec]]-style ball") is a team sport similar to a net-less tennis game.  The players wear sturdy, elaborately decorated gloves affixed to a heavy flat striking surface, using them to strike a small solid ball. The game has roots extending back hundreds, or perhaps thousands, of years.

Today, the game is played in the [[Mexican state]] of [[Oaxaca]] and [[Guerrero]] and in emigrant communities including those in the [[Mexico City]], [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] and [[Fresno, California|Fresno]] areas.

The members of each five-player team take their positions on one-half of a long narrow court—roughly 100 m long by 11 m wide—which has been measured out on compacted soil.  To serve, the ball is first bounced on a flat stone, and then struck on the rebound.  The complex scoring system is similar to tennis.

==Gloves, balls, and variations==
The large gloves, which are usually studded with nails, weigh between 3–6&nbsp;kg (7-12&nbsp;lbs).<ref>Penick. Martinez.</ref>  Although the ball was traditionally made of wool,<ref>Federación Mexicana de Juegos y Deportes Autóctonos y Tradicionales.</ref> a wide variety of materials are used today:

*The most commonly played game uses a ball made of rubber rolled with stocking thread, and fitted with a suede outer lining.  The resultant ball weighs about 300-330&nbsp;grams (12&nbsp;oz) and measures 8–10&nbsp;cm (3–4&nbsp;in) in diameter (see photo on left). To differentiate it from other versions, this game is sometimes referred to as ''pelota mixteca de forro'' ("Mixtec-style lined ball").<ref>Penick. Filloy Nadal (p. 30) finds a slightly lighter ball, at 170-280 grams.</ref>
*A version named ''pelota mixteca de hule'' ("Mixtec-style rubber ball") uses a heavier, 900&nbsp;gram rubber ball, with no outer lining, often painted in bright colors (see photo above).<ref>Federación Mexicana de Juegos y Deportes Autóctonos y Tradicionales, which also states that a heavier glove is used, weighing between 5 and 7 kg.</ref>
*A version of the game played in the Los Angeles area uses a plastic ball weighing 1-1½  kg.<ref>Martinez.</ref>
*The little-known ''pelota mixteca del valle'' uses a very light (less than 100&nbsp;gram) sponge ball which is struck with a wooden paddle strapped to the hand.<ref>Federación Mexicana de Juegos y Deportes Autóctonos y Tradicionales.</ref>

The game is claimed by many writers to be a descendent of the 3000+ year old [[Mesoamerican ballgame]], perhaps the particular version shown on reliefs at the Mixtec archaeological site of [[Dainzu]].<ref>See, for example, Taladoire.</ref> Heiner Gillmeister, on the other hand, has argued that ''pelota mixteca'' may instead be descended from a Franco-[[Flemish people|Flemish]] ancestor of [[real tennis]], likely through intermediate games similar to the [[Basque pelota]] or [[Valencian pilota]], and from there brought to [[New Spain]]<ref>Gillmeister, p. 71-75, which is supported by Collins, p. 259.</ref>  and this would put the game's roots back  400 years ago.
