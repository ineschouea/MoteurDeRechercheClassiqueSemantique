The '''branch coral''' (''Acropora florida'') is a species of [[Acroporidae|acroporid]] [[coral]] found in the southwest and northern Indian Ocean, the central [[Indo-Pacific]], Australia, Southeast Asia, Japan and the [[East China Sea]], [[Cook Islands]] and the oceanic west Pacific Ocean. It can be found in shallow reefs on the reef tops, walls and slopes to depths of 30&nbsp;m.

==Description==
[[Colony (biology)|Colonies]] of ''Acropora florida'' consist of thick upright, and sometimes horizontal, branches growing from a sprawling or encrusting base. There are side branches and small branchlets which resemble knobs. The [[corallite]]s are evenly spread. The colour of this coral varies, and may be pinkish-brown or some shade of green.<ref name=WoRMS/>

==Biology==
''Acropora florida'' is a [[Zooxanthellae|zooxanthellate]] species of coral.<ref name=WoRMS/> It obtains most of its nutritional needs from the [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]] [[dinoflagellate]]s that live inside its soft tissues. These [[Photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] organisms provide the coral with organic carbon and nitrogen, sometimes providing up to 90% of their host's energy needs for metabolism and growth. Its remaining needs are met by the [[plankton]]ic organisms caught by the tentacles of the polyps.<ref name=Ruppert>{{cite book |title=Invertebrate Zoology |edition=7th |last1=Ruppert |first1=Edward E. |last2=Fox |first2=Richard, S. |last3=Barnes |first3=Robert D. |year=2004 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=978-81-315-0104-7 |page=122 }}</ref>

==Status==
This coral is a common species and no species-specific threats have been identified. The main threats faced by corals in general are related to [[climate change]] and the mechanical destruction of their coral reef habitats; increasing damage from extreme weather events, rising sea water temperatures and [[ocean acidification]]. The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] has assessed the conservation status of this species as being "[[near threatened]]". All corals receive protection by being listed on [[CITES Appendix II]].<ref name=iucn/>
