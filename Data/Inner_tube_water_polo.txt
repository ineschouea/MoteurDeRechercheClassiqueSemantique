'''Inner tube water polo''' (ITWP) is a variation of the sport [[water polo]] with the important difference that players, excluding the [[goalkeeper]], are required to float in inflatable [[inner tube]]s.  By floating in an inner tube, players experience less contact and expend less energy than traditional water polo players, not having to [[tread water]].  This allows casual players to enjoy water polo without undertaking the intense conditioning required for conventional water polo.

This sport is predominantly played at universities by [[intramural]] [[coed]] teams,<ref>[http://www.imprintmagazine.org/life_and_style/not_your_ordinary_intramurals Cassavaugh, Dan. Not Your Ordinary Intramurals. Imprint Magazine.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123105748/http://imprintmagazine.org/life_and_style/not_your_ordinary_intramurals |date=2010-11-23 }}</ref> but can also be found in recreational adult leagues. The sport's rules resemble those of [[water polo]], however, with no governing body the rules vary across different leagues. For example, while the winner is determined by the team which scores the most goals, some leagues award one point for a male goal, and two points for a female goal, while others award one for either.

* Penalty shots shall be taken by the offended player at the backstroke flags (if no flags exist, it should be 5 meters or 15 feet from goal). 
* No defensive player may be within 2 feet of the shooter.
* If the result of the penalty shot is not a goal, the ball remains in play. 
** Exception: The ball is dead in a shoot-out if the ball does not go in the net.
* A penalty shot will be awarded in the following scenarios:
** A defensive player enters the goal box to make a play.
** A goalie abandons his/her tube to block a shot.

===Goalie===

* The goalie may not abandon his/her tube in an attempt to block a shot from entering the goal. Remember, they do not have to sit in the tube but rather just have a part of their body in/through it at all times.
** If the goalie leaves his/her tube while blocking a shot on goal, this will result in a penalty shot for the offensive team.
* The goalie may never pass the ball beyond the mid-pool line.
* The goalie may not leave the goal box area during play.
* Once the goalie gains possession of the ball, he/she will have 3 seconds to release the ball.
* A ball in play may be passed back to the goalie. The goalie will have 3 seconds to release the ball.
* A goalie can be pulled for another attacking player during normal substitution times (see Substitutions).

===Goals===

* A goal is scored when a legal shot (taken outside the goal box) completely crosses the goal line.
* A player scoring a goal must remain in his/her tube after the goal is scored or the score will be disallowed.
* A shot taken from inside the goal box will be disallowed and the ball will be given to the goalie for a free throw.
* After a goal is scored, the referee will start play in the center of the pool again (see Start of Play).

===Shootouts===

* Five players from each team will be selected by the team to shoot (goalkeepers may be one of the shooters).
* At least 2 men and 2 women must shoot.  They should alternate.
* Shooters do not have to have been in the pool at the end of play. 
* Goalies will be the same as the goalies from the end of play.
* A coin flip or another creative method of determining order will decide which team shoots first.
* Each team has a total of 5 penalty shots and will alternate each shot. No rebounds.
* The referee signals the start of each penalty shot with a whistle blow.
* If the score is tied at the end of the first shootout, a ‘sudden-death’ shootout will ensue.
** Once one team leads after an equal number of shots have taken, the game is over. 
* Only players who shot in the first round are eligible to shoot in the second round. 
* The gender order established in the first round will be maintained in the second round.
* Teams must have an equal ratio of male to females during penalty shots (i.e., both teams must have either 3 women and 2 men or 3 men and 2 women shooting).

===Misconduct===

Most leagues have their own rules governing misconduct, flagrant fouls, and other more egregious penalties.
