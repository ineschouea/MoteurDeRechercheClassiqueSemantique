'''Chuiwan''' ({{zh|c=??|p=Chuíwán|l=ball-hitting}}) was a [[game]] in ancient [[China]]. Its rules resemble modern  [[golf]].

The book ''Dongxuan lu'' (???), written by Wei Tai ((??) [[floruit|fl.]] 1050–1100) of the [[Song dynasty]], describes how a [[southern Tang]] official teaches his daughter how to dig goals in the ground and drive a ball into them.<ref name=ling>{{cite journal |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006031420/http://library.la84.org/SportsLibrary/ASSH%20Bulletins/No%2014/ASSHBulletin14c.pdf |title=Verification of the Fact that Golf originated From Chuiwan |journal=The Australian Society for Sports History Bulletin |issue=14 |author=Ling Hongling |year=1991}}</ref> The game became popular by the Song dynasty; and a work called ''Wan jing'' (?? – literally "ball-treatise") of the [[Yuan dynasty]] was specially devoted to it.<ref name=ling/> The latest documents about ''chuiwan'' in China are from the two paintings of the [[Ming dynasty]] from the 15th century.<ref name=ling/> There is a colour image of the mural painting still preserved on the wall of a Water God Temple in [[Hongdong]], [[Shanxi]].<ref name=ling/> A Chinese scholar suggested the game was exported to Europe and then [[Scotland]] by [[Mongols|Mongolian]] travellers in the late [[Middle Ages]].

The rules for Chuiwan are remarkably similar to that of modern golf, in that players use restricted number of clubs (up to 10 in Chuiwan, 14 in golf), holes are spread on terrains of varying difficulty, and marked by colored flags; and there is also strict etiquette and rules with regard to player honesty, with penalties for cheating. Chuiwan balls are of different sizes and made of wood. The tee-off areas are called ''ji'', which means "base" in Chinese.<ref name=chuiwan_cui>{{cite journal|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303230827/http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/cn_zgwh/2008-07/18/content_109631_2.htm|title=Ancient Chuiwan Game|journal=Pictorial Journal of Chinese Culture|author=??? |year=2008}}</ref>

Popularity of this game of Chuiwan peaked in [[Song dynasty]], when [[Ukhaantu Khan, Emperor Huizong of Yuan|Emperor Huizong]] was reported a dedicated player, it remained a favorite sport during [[Yuan dynasty]] and [[Ming dynasty]], in [[Qing dynasty]] game of Chuiwan steadily declined, when it became casual game for women and children.<ref name=chuiwan_cui/>
