'''Cycle polo''' is a [[team sport]], similar to traditional [[polo]], except that [[bicycle]]s are used instead of horses. There are two versions of the sport: grass and [[Hardcourt Bike Polo]]. The hardcourt game saw a sharp spike in interest in the first decade of the 21st century<ref name="punk">{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8177668.stm | title=Polo's young punk cousin | publisher=BBC | date=31 July 2009 | accessdate=10 June 2015}}</ref> and new teams are sprouting up across the world, in China, Canada, Ireland, Switzerland, France, India, Germany, Pakistan, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Hungary, Australia, New Zealand, Sweden, England, Scotland, Argentina, Italy, Spain, USA, Poland, Croatia, Slovenia, Lithuania, Nepal, Brazil and Cuba.

== The Traditional game ==

Traditional cycle polo is played in a rectangular grass field, {{Convert|150x100|metres||abbr=}} officially, unofficially whatever field is big enough. Moreover, official dimensions can vary between {{Convert|120x150|metres||abbr=}} in length on {{Convert|80x100|metres||abbr=}} in width. The ball used approximately {{Convert|2.5|in||abbr=}} in diameter and the mallet is of length {{Convert|1|metre||abbr=}}.

There are six members (seven in France) in a team of which four (five in France) are on field at any one time. The other two are used as substitutes. International matches are played for a duration of 30 minutes divided into periods of 7.5 minutes each called as a ''chukkar''. Extra time can be used to determine the winner in case the scores are tied at normal time.

If a deliberate foul is committed at the vicinity of the goal, the team that is fouled is automatically given a goal. Less severe fouls are awarded 15-metre and 25-metre free hits. In the event of deliberate fouls or dangerous fouls, the umpire can issue a yellow card (warning) and in case of repeated or severe fouls a red card (ejection). The ejected player can be replaced by a substitute after the end of the current ''chukkar'' if the umpire allows it.

== The Hardcourt game ==

{{main article|Hardcourt Bike Polo}}

In recent years, an alternate form of the game known as "[[Hardcourt Bike Polo]]" has grown in popularity.<ref name="punk"/>  In this variation, teams composed of three players compete on tennis courts, street hockey rinks, or whatever other surfaces are available.  The rules vary slightly by city.

Generally this is a faster game with three members on a team and no substitutions, and with all members on the court at all times. A [[street hockey]] ball is used and matches are played until one team scores five points or time has expired, without playing chukkars. During tournament play, a time limit, such as 10 minutes, may be used to maximise the number of tournament rounds possible during the day.

There are three core rules of play:

In the case of a 'foot down' or 'dab' (touching the ground with one's foot) the player must "tap out" by riding to mid-court and hitting a designated area with their mallet. There is usually a tap-out located on either side of the court.

In order to score, the offensive player must hit the ball across the goal line using the narrow end of the mallet, called a "shot" or "hit." Hitting the ball across the goal line with the wide end of the mallet is called a "shuffle".

When a team scores a goal, the opposing team must retreat to their half and wait for the other team (player or ball, whichever comes first) to cross the halfway line before engaging in play again.

The [[North American Hardcourt Bike Polo Association]] has created an official ruleset,<ref>[http://www.nahardcourt.com/rules Official North American ruleset]</ref> which has helped standardise rules across the globe.

== History ==
The game was invented in County Wicklow, Ireland, in 1891 by retired champion cyclist [[Richard J. Mecredy]], editor of ''The Irish Cyclist'' magazine.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/london/hi/people_and_places/2012/newsid_8845000/8845620.stm | title=Could a lost Olympic sport find its way back to London? | publisher=BBC | date=23 July 2010 | first1=Arun | last1=Mahey | first2=Jessica | last2=Brand | accessdate=5 March 2019 }}</ref> In October of that year the first cycle polo match was played at the Scalp (County Wicklow) between ''Rathclaren Rovers'' and the ''Ohne Hast Cycling Club''.<ref name=velo>{{cite web|author=polovelo |url=http://www.polo-velo.net/english/history/history.htm |title=Cycle polo story |publisher=Polo-velo.net |date= |accessdate=2010-10-01}}</ref>
Towards the end of the 19th century the game reached Great Britain, France, and the United States where the [[American Star Bicycle]] was a popular mount.<ref>{{cite book

The sport reached its peak of popularity in Great Britain during the 1930s with the introduction of the regional leagues. Cycle polo also flourished in France during this period with the establishment of the French league. Internationals between France and Great Britain were held regularly. However the Second World War marked the beginning of the demise of cycle polo in Britain. The sport remained in France though, with league championships held regularly until today.

The 1980s saw the rise of two new powers in cycle polo, India and the United States. The Bicycle Polo Association of America was created in 1994. International cycle polo matches staged a comeback in the 1990s with the first world championship organized in 1996 in the USA. Today there is organized cycle polo being played in Brazil, Argentina, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Great Britain, India, Ireland, Malaysia, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Switzerland and USA. Cycle polo was officially recognized by the [[Union Cycliste Internationale]] in 2001.
