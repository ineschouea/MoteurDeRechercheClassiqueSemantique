'''Fuzzball''' is a [[Bat-and-ball games|bat-and-ball]] [[street game]] related to [[baseball]], usually formed as a pick-up game, and played in various areas of the [[United States]] (especially [[St. Louis]], but also in [[Chicago]] where it is called "strikeout", [[Florida]], and [[South Carolina]]). The equipment consists of a bat and a [[tennis ball]] that has had its outer layer burned or worn off.<ref name=esquire>{{cite web |author=Charles P.

==Game play==
Summit Fuzzball League rules follow the same general rule structure as [[baseball]], with the finer details varying considerably by region.  The one consistent difference between fuzzball and [[baseball]] is the use of a tennis ball instead of a baseball.  Players may or may not use a baseball glove while fielding.

Indoor fuzzball is usually played inside of a large net with no base runners. Outdoor fuzzball can be played either on paved school playgrounds (typically marked off for [[kickball]]) or on a baseball or [[softball]] field. Serious players will also use a cigarette lighter or a blowtorch to burn the felt off of the ball, thereby making it much faster when pitched. Bats may consist of [[broom]] handles,<ref name=commonspace /> [[baseball]] bats, [[corkball]] bats, or official fuzzball bats, such as those made by [[Markwort Sporting Goods]] of St. Louis, Missouri. Markwort also makes an official fuzzball for use in games.

The batter may be out after one, two or three strikes.  The batter may also walk after three, four, or five balls.  If a batter is hit by a pitch, it can be worth two balls or the strike count may be reset.  Once again, this depends on regional rules. If the ball lands behind a fence, on a roof, on a porch, or breaks a window far away it is usually ruled a home run.  In some versions of fuzzball where space is a concern, hits are decided by how far the ball travels, in which case there is no running (similar to [[corkball]]).<ref name=commonspace />

If small teams play, "ghost runners" can take the place of an on-base player who must go back to home plate to bat once more.  Ghost runners move the same number of bases as the batter gets on a hit.  For example, if a "ghost runner" is on second base and the batter hits a double, the ghost runner passes home plate and scores a run.

Game length (including innings and outs-per-inning) also varies considerably from region to region.  A popular version of fuzzball played in the western [[Summit, NJ]] suburbs involves nine two-out innings as well as a twenty-run mercy limit.
