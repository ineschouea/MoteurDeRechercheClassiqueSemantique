'''''Acanthobrama lissneri''''', or the '''Jordan bream''',<ref name=IUCN/> is a [[species]] of freshwater fish in the [[Cyprinidae]] family. It is found in [[Israel]] and [[Jordan]]. Its natural [[habitat]]s are rivers and lakes, and is now commonly found in reservoirs.

==Distribution and threats==
The Jordan bream is found in the [[Jordan River]] drainage basin and the on the coastal plain of Palestine in the Nahr al-Muqatta ([[Qishon River]]).<ref>{{FishBase|genus=Acanthobrama|species=lissneri|month=May|year=2014}}</ref> It has been introduced into the [[Azraq Wetland Reserve]].

It is widely distributed and locally abundant, particularly in lakes such as [[Sea of Galilee|Lake Kinneret]], but there have been significant declines in riverine parts of its range. It is threatened by [[habitat loss]] as water extraction is impacting the lakes and rivers in this region. Pollution in the waters is also a threat in certain localities. Nevertheless, it is able to inhabit reservoirs and other artificial water bodies which compensates for the losses in rivers and streams.
