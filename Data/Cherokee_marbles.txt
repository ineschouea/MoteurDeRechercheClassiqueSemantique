'''Cherokee marbles''' (??????, '''digadayosdi'''), or ''five hole,'' is a traditional game among the [[Cherokee]] people of the [[United States]].

==The game==
It is played, traditionally, with round balls made of stone, but now sometimes with standard [[billiard balls]]. An annual tournament is held during [[Cherokee National Holiday]] each [[Labor Day]] weekend.

==History==
The origin of the game is unknown, and it is not mentioned in the works of ethnologist [[James Mooney]].<ref>Conley, Robert J. ''A Cherokee Encyclopedia.'' Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, 2007. Page 144.</ref>

Cherokee marbles is a similar game to the rolley hole [[marbles]] played by [[Anglo-America]]ns in [[Kentucky]] and [[Tennessee]], though the dimensions are different and rolley hole uses three holes instead of five.<ref>Bilger, Burkhard. ''Noodling for Flatheads''. New York: Simon & Schuster, 2001. Page 210.</ref>

More recently, the game has been introduced into the public schools in Northeast Oklahoma, by the Cherokee Nation, as part of a program to discourage [[methamphetamine]] abuse.<ref>[http://www.turtleisland.org/discussion/viewtopic.php?t=4153&highlight=cherokee+nation+meth TurtleIsland.org :: View topic - Cherokee children play games to fight drugs<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
