'''Fascination''' is a [[game]] commonly found in [[North America]]n [[amusement park]]s, [[boardwalk]]s and [[video arcade|arcade]]s. The game would be considered in the same family as [[skee ball]], in that prizes are often won for playing the game. The game dates to the 1920s as evidenced in pictures of Chutes at the Beach in San Francisco, a park that operated from 1903 - 1928 (when it became Playland at the Beach).

==Game design and play==
The game consists of a wooden table, roughly 1.3 meters long, 50 centimeters wide and 1 meter high. The player sits at one narrow end of the table. At the other end of the table is a series of 25 holes, roughly 5&nbsp;cm in diameter, arranged in a five-by-five square [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]. The player rolls a rubber ball, similar to a [[racquetball]] or [[American handball|handball]], toward the holes; the ball is only slightly smaller than the holes. As the ball falls through one of the holes, a light on a backboard behind the holes lights up, in a pattern corresponding to the hole the ball fell through. The ball then rolls back to the player on a slight incline slanted back from the holes. The process is repeated until a player lights five lights in a row, either across the matrix, in a vertical column, or on a diagonal, much like [[Bingo (US)|bingo]]&mdash;indeed, like bingo, the hole in the center of the matrix is a "free space." A glass plate over the front part of the table keeps players from reaching too far over the table to improve their aim.

Fascination tables are typically installed in groups from 20 to 50,but can be in as small a system of 2, up to any amount without limit, and are interlocked through an [[electromechanical]], and/or electronic system. Players play against each other, with the first player to complete a row of five being the winner, with the interlocking system determining which was first and locking out all others. If two or more players tie, each is declared a winner. Games usually cost 10 to 50 [[Cent (currency)|cents]] each, normally placed on the glass plate where a game operator can collect it shortly after each game begins. Games usually last between 60 and 90 [[second]]s, with a new game starting soon after the end of the previous one.

Winners receive a prize [[coupon]] or [[Token coin|token]], which can be redeemed for a small prize, or collected to redeem for bigger prizes later, or in some locations, coupons may be redeemed as cash to play more games. Bonus coupons or tokens can be won by winning with all spots lighted on a certain row marked by colored lights; usually, the top row on the board (the back row of holes) is red and wins three to five times the normal rate, and the fourth row from the top (the second row of holes from the front) is gold and wins double the normal rate. Some operators have additional bonuses for certain lines. 

An announcer, sitting on an elevated platform, presides over the activities. He or she starts each game by pressing a button which rings a bell and activates all machines. He or she also announces the winner when the bell rings again, which the machine does automatically when a win is detected. One or more assistants collect the fees and pay winners. Other employees run a prize booth, where winners redeem their coupons or tokens. The prizes range from cheap trinkets for one or two wins to [[home appliance|appliance]]s, [[radio]]s, [[television]]s, [[toy]]s and more expensive items for large numbers of coupons or tokens, often numbering into the thousands for the best prizes.

==History==
Fascination was invented in Salt Lake City Utah by John Taylor Gibbs who moved to Beverly Hills California, where he formed the business Taylor Engineering Corp.{{citationneeded|date=March 2019}}

The game was a popular attraction at amusement parks before the modern [[theme park]] drained visitors away to the newer, more modern facilities. When the old-line amusement parks died off, the Fascination parlors went with them. The game was also popular in oceanside resort towns, particularly those with boardwalks and especially on the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic shorelines of the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. [[Coney Island]], [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]] and [[Wildwood, New Jersey]] were popular places with multiple Fascination parlors; Wildwood is home to three remaining parlors. On the west coast there is a Fascination parlor on Seaside Oregon. The oldest remaining Fascination game is in Nantasket Beach, MA, and is the original 1918 game from Coney Island.

The game has declined not only because of the demise of old-style amusement parks, but also the age of the machines themselves. The heart of the system relied on [[relay]]s used in [[telephone]] system, which have long been obsolete; moreover, manufacturers of the tables have long ago shut down, so spare parts have to be salvaged from old tables. Operation is also labor-intensive, with at least three employees (often more) at a time required to run a game. The game could easily be made more reliable and less labor-intensive with updated [[computer]]-based technology (as was done in the mid-1990s at the Indiana Beach parlor) and automatic coin collection and coupon dispensing equipment such as that on a skee ball game, but the closure of many Fascination parlors has made such an effort unlikely.

A modern arcade game called "Lite-a-Line" can be found today, with roots in Fascination in that it features the same basic game play and pays off in redemption tickets. However, Lite-a-Line is a stand-alone game, played against "the house" as with skee ball and the like. It is commonly found in places such as [[Chuck E. Cheese]]. (It should not be confused with a 1930s [[pinball]] machine of the same name. Moreover, some Internet sites indicate that there may have been Fascination parlors that instead operated under the name "Lite-a-Line," but the evidence is inconclusive.)

"I-Got-It" is a variant of fascination invented in 1961 in [[Western New York]].<ref>https://www.wkbw.com/news/popular-carnival-game-began-in-western-new-york</ref> Its mechanism is slightly different in that balls are tossed over an open pit instead of rolled, and the ball does not return to the player, staying in place throughout the game unless it is knocked out of place by another thrown ball. I-Got-It is seen most frequently in traveling carnivals.
