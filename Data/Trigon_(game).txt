'''Trigon''' was a ball game played by the [[ancient Rome|ancient Romans]].<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dtrigon trigon], Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short, ''A Latin Dictionary'', on Perseus</ref> The name derives from [[Greek language|Greek]] ???????? (''trig?nos''), " three-cornered, triangular",<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dtri%2Fgwnos ????????], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref> and it may have been  a romanized version of a Greek game called ?????? (''trig?n'').<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dtri%2Fgwn ??????], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref> It was a type of [[juggling]] game,<ref>Reet Howell, Maxwell Leo Howell, ''Physical education foundations'', p.81, Albion, 1986</ref> probably involved three players standing in a triangle (hence the name) and passing a hard ball back and forth, catching with the right and throwing with the left hand. Besides the three players, called ''trigonali'', there were also assistants called ''pilecripi'', who kept score and retrieved runaway balls.

==Description in the ''Satyricon''==

[[Petronius]]'s ''[[Satyricon]]'' has a description of a ball game usually assumed to be trigon, although its name is never mentioned. The bald old man Trimalchio is playing with a couple of young curly-haired slave boys. Trimalchio is obviously not a serious trigon player because he plays in his sandals, and he never stoops to retrieve the ball but instead has a servant replace it with a fresh ball from a big sack. When he snapped his fingers, a slave brought him water to wash his hands, and when he was finished he dried his hands with the long curly hair of the young slave boys.

Petronius also remarks that in this case, the ''pilecripus'' did not count the number of times the players successfully passed the ball, but instead the number of balls that dropped on the ground. This may be a joke making fun of Trimalchio's low level of skill, or simply an innovative scoring method.

==Rules==

A minimum of three people are required to play trigon. Three people would stand in a triangle formation and would trike the ball towards the person to the right of them with their right hand. The players catch incoming balls with their left hand. <ref>[https://archive.org/details/jstor-282704], McDaniel, "Some Passages concerning Ball-Games"</ref> Trigon was usually played with more than one ball. More than three people could participate in trigon. There were other roles in the game, like scorekeeper and someone who would retrieve stray balls <ref>[http://www.steiner-verlag.de/titel/56921.html] Andrea Jördens,
