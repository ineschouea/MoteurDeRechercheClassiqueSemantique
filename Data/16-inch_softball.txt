==Game play==
Game play for 16-inch softball is mostly consistent with standard [[Softball#Gameplay|softball game play]]. Compared to standard or 12-inch softball, it is played with a ball 16" (41&nbsp;cm) in circumference. Leagues may form co-ed, all-male or all-female teams. Additionally, teams may choose competitive or recreational leagues. There may be rule variations associated with the specific field or league of play. When playing in a co-ed league, there may be other rules that apply related to the male to female ratio of team members and batting order.<ref name="CSS Rules">{{cite web|title=Chicago Sport and Social Rules|url=http://www.chicagosocial.com/leagues/rules.php?league_rule_id=19|accessdate=2011-04-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919141614/http://chicagosocial.com/leagues/rules.php?league_rule_id=19|archive-date=2010-09-19|dead-url=yes|df=}}</ref><ref name="CSS men's rules">{{cite web|title=Chicago Sport and social Rules|url=http://www.chicagosocial.com/leagues/rules.php?league_rule_id=20|accessdate=2011-04-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919141227/http://chicagosocial.com/leagues/rules.php?league_rule_id=20|archive-date=2010-09-19|dead-url=yes|df=}}</ref> The [[National Softball Association]] (NSA) also has a published set of rules governing 16-inch softball play.<ref name="NSA rule book">{{cite web|title=2011 NSA Rule Book|url=http://www.playnsa.com/uploads/2011RuleBook11.pdf|accessdate=2011-04-15}}{{Dead link|date=February 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

==History==
The earliest known softball game of any kind was played at the Farragut Boat Club in Chicago on Thanksgiving Day 1887. The first softball was a wrapped up boxing glove and the bat was a broom. Play was encouraged by a reporter, [[George Hancock (softball)|George Hancock]], who had been looking on. Harvard and Yale students played the game while waiting to hear the results of the annual [[Harvard-Yale football game]].

Until the turn of the 20th century, ball sizes ranged from 12 to 17 inches in circumference. The 16-inch softball was eventually adopted in Chicago, perhaps because it didn't travel as far as the popular 12- or 14-inch balls. This also may have allowed for play on smaller [[playground]]s or even indoors, accommodating the Chicago landscape and climate. Another possible advantage of the 16-inch ball was that it allowed everyone to play barehanded, and gloves were a rare luxury as the [[Great Depression]] hit Chicago particularly hard.

After the first national championship held in 1933 at the [[Century of Progress|Century of Progress World's Fair]], the sport grew in popularity. A professional league was formed that lasted through the 1950s. Teams drew crowds of over 10,000 each night. Leagues continue today but not at the same level of popularity. There are co-ed recreational leagues, competitive leagues and even a league for [[Chicago Public School]] students.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chicago 16 INCH Softball Hall of Fame |url=http://www.16inchsoftballhof.com/history.asp |accessdate=2011-04-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327134311/http://www.16inchsoftballhof.com/history.asp |archivedate=2010-03-27 |df= }}</ref>

==League and tournament play==
Many local organizations host regular season play, typically weekly games, as well as their own playoff systems. National organizations, such as the NSA, host a variety of tournaments. By placing well in NSA tournaments, teams can qualify and compete for the 16-inch softball world series.<ref>{{cite web|title=Play NSA Website|url=http://www.playnsa.com/WorldSeries.aspx|accessdate=2011-04-15}}</ref> Because local leagues may have slight variations in rules, the NSA world series is played by its own set of world series rules. One notable change is that Chicago area players, who typically are not allowed to wear gloves, may choose to wear gloves in world series games.<ref name="NSA rule book" />

==Blooperball==
In the [[Bay City, Michigan]] area the game is known as "blooperball." Blooperball has been played in the area continuously since the [[1930s]] and there is a ten-team league for players forty years old and over,<ref>http://www.bcbloop.com/</ref> as well as a charity blooperball event called "The Rehab," which has been held the weekend after [[Labor Day]] for almost forty years.

Games are played with a deBeer Clincher 16" ball and gloves are used.

==Hall of Fame==
In 1996 Al Maag and Tony Reibel established the 16" Softball Hall of Fame. Since inception, the organization has held annual inductee dinners attended by over 600 guests. There is a museum in [[Forest Park, Illinois]], a suburb of Chicago. The Chicago 16" Softball Hall of Fame is a registered [[501(c)]] [[not-for-profit organization]].<ref>{{cite web|title=16" Softball Hall of Fame|url=http://www.16inchsoftballhof.com/museum.asp|work=hall of fame|accessdate=2011-04-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906014934/http://www.16inchsoftballhof.com/museum.asp|archive-date=2011-09-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}</ref>
