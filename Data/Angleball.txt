==History Notes==
The first high school game played was in the late 1960s at Pioneer Ranch in Tidioute, Pennsylvania, when the Corry High School Beavers football team hosted the Titusville Rockets team. Corry's athletic director and head football coach, Lou Hanna, and Titusville's athletic director, Roy Van Horn, had been teammates on the 1939 [[Slippery Rock University of Pennsylvania|Slippery Rock State Teachers College]] undefeated championship [[American football|football]] team.<ref name="vanhorn">[http://www.rockathletics.com/hof.aspx?hof=26&path=&kiosk=], Roy Van Horn, Slippery Rock Hall of Fame.</ref> The game was won by Corry.

Van Horn was the owner of Pioneer Ranch, a boys camp on the [[Allegheny River]] near [[Tidioute, Pennsylvania]]. With Hanna, he founded the Northwestern Pennsylvania Football Camp at Pioneer Ranch in 1961, the nation's first summertime football camp for [[High school football|high school gridders]], and hired Penn State's coaches to staff it.<ref name="pioneercamp">{{cite web|url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1022835/index.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130102060546/http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1022835/index.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-01-02 |title=Sweat Shopping: Though rife with NCAA violations, college-run football camps have become bull markets for recruiters |publisher=''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' |last=Dohrmann |first=George |date=2001-06-25 |accessdate=2008-03-20 }}</ref> It was here a relationship with Rip Engle was formed, and they were first introduced to anejodi.

In 2011 at the 100th year celebration of the Dept. of Kinesiology at Penn State, an  Angleball association set was featured in "The Ball Games of the World Exhibit" presented by Dr. Ken Swalgin, Associate Professor of Kinesiology.  The exhibit includes over 80 balls, equipment, and posters depicting ball sports from around the world. Ball sports are categorized as follows: handball games, bowls and bowling, ball and bat games, racket and paddle games, football games, ball and raised goal games, invasion goal games, and other ball games.(Swalgin, K.L. 2011).

In 2012, an Angleball set was adopted by the NFL's Philadelphia Eagles for preseason conditioning.

In September 2013, American Angleball sponsored the first angleball match in Africa (Masaka, Uganda) with the help of Sporting Is The Answer.
