'''Rink bandy''' and '''rinkball''' are variants of [[bandy]] played on significantly smaller [[ice rink]]s. While a [[bandy field|bandy rink]] is about the same size as a [[football pitch]], rink bandy is played on [[ice hockey rink]]s.

Rink bandy originated in [[Sweden]] in the 1960s and was originally called '''hockeybockey'''.<ref>[http://www.skelleftea.org/forening/spif/rbandy/r_start.htm Skelleftepolisens IF - ''Rinkbandy''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040121040252/http://www.skelleftea.org/forening/spif/rbandy/r_start.htm |date=2004-01-21 }}</ref> With the arrival of indoor ice hockey arenas, it was a way for [[bandy]] players to practice on ice a longer time of the year; as [[bandy field]]s are larger, they were still only made outdoors in the wintertime when artificial freezing was not necessary.

The game uses a [[bandy ball]] and bandy sticks. The goalkeeper has no stick. As in hockey, a game lasts 60 minutes, but is composed of either two 30 minute halves or three 20 minute periods. Similar rules to normal bandy are used, but they are simplified to increase the pace of the game. [[Checking (ice hockey)|Checking]] is prohibited, making the sport relatively safer than its relatives. Because of the smaller playing area, there are fewer players, normally six a side. In the [[Bandy in the United States#League_play|USA Rink Bandy League]], five players are used because of the smaller ice hockey rinks there.

Rink bandy is governed by the [[Federation of International Bandy]]. In its quest to have bandy accepted into the programme of the [[Winter Olympics]], rink bandy is an important way for the Federation of International Bandy to gain more members, thus also spreading bandy, since many countries, which lack a full-size field and where the game is still new, only play rink bandy at home but still participate in the [[Bandy World Championship]]. 

As artificially frozen and indoor bandy arenas have become more prevalent, the interest for rink bandy has dwindled in the main bandy-playing nations (Russia, Sweden, Finland, Norway). There are still several rink bandy tournaments in [[Russia]],<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qhuUv9bBQg Video of the 2nd half between [[Lokomotiv Orenburg]] and [[CSK VVS Samara (ice hockey)|CSK VVS Samara]] in the 2011 Russian Rink Bandy Cup]</ref> including the Patriarch Cup ({{lang|ru|?????? ?? ????? ?????????? ????????? ??????????? ? ???? ????}}<ref>http://uniorsport.ru/bandy_kp_2017.php</ref>) for children at [[Moscow]]'s [[Red Square]].<ref>https://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en&sl=ru&u=https://pravoslavie.ru/68869.html</ref>

A world cup for rink bandy clubs was held every year from 1984-1998 in [[Hofors]], Sweden, and called [[Hofors World Cup]]. Rink bandy was included in the programme of the 2012 European Company Sports Games<ref>http://www.visitsodradalarna.se/en/ECSG-2012/Sports/Rinkbandy/</ref> and a European championship existed, though there is currently no top-level international competition.

==Rinkball==
In the 1970s rinkball, which is played by more ice hockey-like sticks, grew from being played in local tournaments by villagers around Finland to national-level competitions involving 100 teams or more. The sport first gained international attention in 1984 when teams from [[Finland]] and Sweden hosted one another. The International Rinkball Association was formed soon after, and in the late 1990s included [[Russia]], Sweden, [[Kazakhstan]], [[Estonia]], [[Switzerland]], [[Hungary]], Finland and the [[United States]].<ref name="Rinkball history"/> The Finnish Rinkball Federation has 1000 teams, including women, men and children. Play is divided into eight male divisions, two female divisions, and children's play is divided by age.<ref>[http://www.kaukalopalloliitto.fi/ Finnish Rinkball and Ringette Federation]</ref> The first World Championship Games for men was held in [[Omsk]], Russia, in 1998.<ref name="Rinkball history">[http://rinkball.ru/history/hist3.htm Rinkball history]</ref>

The Rinkball League in Finland publishes a magazine called ''Liiga Extra'', which offers international coverage of tournaments, equipment, and tips. In Finland, leagues and a national championship is held annually (as of 2016).
