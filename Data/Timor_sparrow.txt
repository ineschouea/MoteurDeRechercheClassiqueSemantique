The '''Timor sparrow''', (''Lonchura fuscata'') also known as '''Timor dusky sparrow''' is a small, approximately 14&nbsp;cm long, plump dark brown [[songbird]] with a large silvery-blue [[Beak|bill]], white cheek, pink feet and creamy-white belly. Both sexes are similar.

Its appearance resembles the closely related [[Java sparrow]], but is smaller than the latter and has different coloured plumage. The Timor sparrow inhabits the grasslands and lowlands of [[West Timor]], [[Semau]] and [[Rote Island]] of [[Indonesia]], and [[East Timor]]. Its diet consists mainly of rice and seeds.

Due to ongoing habitat loss, limited range and illegal trapping for cage-bird trade, the Timor sparrow is evaluated as [[near threatened]] on the [[IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]].  Some taxonomists place this species and the Java sparrow in their own genus, ''Padda''.
