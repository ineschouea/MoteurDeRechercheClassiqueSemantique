'''''Jeu de paume''''' ({{IPA-fr|?ø d(?) pom}}; {{lang-en|"palm game"}}) is a ball-and-court game that originated in [[France]]. It was an indoor precursor of [[tennis]] played without [[racquet]]s, though these were eventually introduced. It is a former [[Olympic sport]], and has the oldest ongoing annual world championship in sport, first established over 250 years ago.  Originally spelled '''''jeu de paulme''''', now it is called "'''[[real tennis]]'''" ,  '''''court tennis''''' (US) or '''''courte paume''''' (France).

Even when paddle-like bats, and finally racquets, became standard equipment for the game by the late 17th century, the name did not change.  It became known as "tennis" in English ''(see [[Tennis#History|History of tennis]])'', and later "[[real tennis]]" after the derived game of [[Tennis|lawn tennis]] became the more widely known sport.

The term is used in France today to denote the game of tennis on a court in which the ancient or modern game might be played. The indoor version is sometimes called ''jeu de courte paume'' or just ''courte paume'' ("short palm") to distinguish it from the outdoor version, ''[[longue paume]]'' ("long palm"), played on a field of variable length.

Since 1740, jeu de paume has been the subject of an amateur world championship, held each year in September. It is the oldest active trophy in international sport.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

The painter [[Jacques-Louis David]]'s famous sketch, ''le Serment du jeu de paume'' ('the [[Tennis Court Oath]]') now hangs in the court of the [[Palace of Versailles]]. It depicts a seminal moment of the [[French Revolution]], when, on 20 June 1789, deputies of the Estates-General met at the court and vowed that they would not disband before the proclamation of a formal Constitution for France.

''Le Jeu de Paume'' is a moral ode published in 1791 by [[André Chénier]].

In the 1981 film ''[[The French Lieutenant's Woman (film)|The French Lieutenant's Woman]]'', socialite Charles Smithson ([[Jeremy Irons]]) is seen playing ''jeu de paume'' in London.

The 2014 [[Whitney Biennial]] exhibition featured the premiere of the stop-motion film ''Jeu de Paume'' by [[Joshua Mosley]].
