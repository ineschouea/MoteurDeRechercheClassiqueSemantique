'''Lacrosse''' is a [[team sport]] played with a [[lacrosse stick]] and a [[lacrosse ball]]. Players use the head of the lacrosse stick to carry, pass, catch, and shoot the ball into the goal.

The sport has four versions that have different sticks, fields, rules and equipment: [[field lacrosse]], [[women's lacrosse]], [[box lacrosse]] and [[intercrosse]]. The men's games, field lacrosse (outdoor) and box lacrosse (indoor), are contact sports and all players wear protective gear: [[lacrosse helmet|helmet]], [[lacrosse glove|gloves]], shoulder pads, and elbow pads. The women's game is played outdoors and does not allow body contact but does allow stick to stick contact. The only protective gear required for women players is eyegear, while goalies wear helmets and protective pads. Intercrosse is a mixed-gender non-contact sport played indoors that uses an all-plastic stick and a softer ball.

The sport is governed by the [[Federation of International Lacrosse]].

{{Main|History of lacrosse}}

Lacrosse is part of the cultural tradition of the [[Iroquois]] (''Haudenosaunee'') people, inhabiting what is now [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Pennsylvania]]. Lacrosse may have been developed as early as 1100 AD among indigenous peoples in [[North America]].<ref name=liss>{{cite book |last= Liss |first= Howard |title= Lacrosse |publisher= Funk & Wagnalls |year= 1970 |page= 13}}</ref> By the seventeenth century, it was well-established and was documented by [[Jesuit]] [[missionary]] priests in the territory of present-day Canada.<ref name=vennum>{{cite book |last= Vennum |first= Thomas |title= American Indian Lacrosse: Little Brother of War |publisher= Smithsonian Institution |year= 2002 |isbn= 978-1560983026}}{{page needed |date= May 2014}}</ref>

In the traditional [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|aboriginal Canadian]] version, each team consisted of about 100 to 1,000 men on a field that stretched from about {{convert|500|m|ft|abbr=on}} to {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on}} long.<ref name="STX">{{cite web|url=http://www.stxlacrosse.com/theculture/history.cfm |title=Lacrosse History |accessdate=February 24, 2007 |publisher=[[STX (sports manufacturer)|STX]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070524045912/http://www.stxlacrosse.com/theculture/history.cfm |archivedate=May 24, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}</ref> These games lasted from sunup to sundown for two to three days straight and were played as part of ceremonial ritual, a kind of symbolic warfare, or to give thanks to the Creator or Master.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Lacrosse played a significant role in the community and religious life of tribes across the continent for many years. Early lacrosse was characterized by deep spiritual involvement, befitting the spirit of combat in which it was undertaken. Those who took part did so in the role of [[warriors]], with the goal of bringing glory and honor to themselves and their tribes.<ref>{{cite news|last=Rock |first=Tom |title=More Than a Game |work=Lacrosse Magazine |publisher=[[US Lacrosse]] |date=November–December 2002 |url=http://redhawkslax.com/more-than-a-game-lacrosse-at-the-onondaga-nation-connects-the-current-generation-with-its-ancestors/ |accessdate=March 18, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070822224214/http://www.redhawkslax.com/news.lacrossemag.html |archivedate=August 22, 2007 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}</ref> The game was said to be played "for the Creator" or was referred to as "The Creator's Game."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.oneidaindiannation.com/lacrosse-the-creators-game/|title=Lacrosse, the Creator’s game|work=Oneida Indian Nation|access-date=September 9, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>

[[File:Ball players.jpg|left|thumb| ''Ball Players'' by George Catlin.]]
The French [[Jesuit missions in North America|Jesuit]] missionary [[Jean de Brébeuf]] saw [[Wyandot people|Huron]] tribesmen play the game during 1637 in present-day Ontario. He called it ''la crosse'', "the stick" in French.<ref name=CAencyclopedia /> The name seems to be originated from the French term for [[field hockey]], ''le jeu de la crosse''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.e-lacrosse.com/laxhist4.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19991008114420/http://www.e-lacrosse.com/laxhist4.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 8, 1999 |title=Lacrosse: E-Lacrosse Lacrosse History, Links and Sources |publisher=E-lacrosse.com |accessdate=February 25, 2011 }}</ref>

[[James Smith (frontiersman)|James Smith]] described in some detail a game being played in 1757 by [[Mohawk people]] "wherein now they used a wooden ball, about {{convert|3|in|cm|abbr=on|order=flip}} in diameter, and the instrument they moved it with was a strong staff about {{convert|5|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}} long, with a hoop net on the end of it, large enough to contain the ball."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/stream/accountofremarka00smit#page/76/mode/2up/ |title=An account of the remarkable occurrences in the life and travels of Colonel James Smith |work=Internet Archive |accessdate=November 8, 2017 |pages=77–78}}</ref>

Anglophones from Montreal noticed the game being played by [[Mohawk people]] and started playing themselves in the 1830s.<ref name=CAencyclopedia /> In 1856, [[William George Beers]], a Canadian dentist, founded the [[Montreal Lacrosse Club]].<ref name=filhistory>{{cite web|title=Origin & History|url=https://filacrosse.com/fil/origin-history/|publisher=Federation of International Lacrosse|accessdate=November 15, 2017 |editor=Claydon, Jane}}</ref> In 1860, Beers codified the game, shortening the length of each game and reducing the number of players to 12 per team.<ref name=CAencyclopedia>{{cite web |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/lacrosse/ |title=Lacrosse |work=The Canadian Encyclopedia |first=Barbara K. |last=Adamski}}</ref> The first game played under Beers's rules was at [[Upper Canada College]] in 1867; they lost to the [[Toronto Cricket Club]] by a score of 3–1.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

The new sport proved to be very popular and spread across the English-speaking world; [[List of the oldest lacrosse teams|by 1900 there were dozens of men's clubs]] in Canada, the United States, England, Australia, and New Zealand. The [[women's lacrosse#History|women's game was introduced]] by [[Louisa Lumsden]] in Scotland in 1890. The first women's club in the United States was started by [[Rosabelle Sinclair]] at [[Bryn Mawr School]] in 1926.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.brynmawrschool.org/page/about/history |title=History |publisher=Bryn Mawr School |accessdate=December 2, 2017}}</ref>

In the United States, lacrosse during the late 1800s and first half of the 1900s was primarily a regional sport centered around the [[Mid-Atlantic states]], especially [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Maryland]]. However, in the last half of the 20th century, the sport spread outside this region, and can be currently found in most of the United States. According to a survey conducted by [[US Lacrosse]] in 2016, there are over 825,000 lacrosse participants nationwide and lacrosse is the fastest-growing team sport among [[National Federation of State High School Associations|NFHS]] member schools.<ref name="participation">{{cite web|title=2016 Participation Survey|url=https://www.uslacrosse.org/sites/default/files/public/documents/about-us-lacrosse/participation-survey-2016.pdf|publisher=US Lacrosse}}</ref>

==Versions of lacrosse==

===Field lacrosse===
{{Main|Field lacrosse}}
[[File:Mens lacrosse diagram.svg|thumb|Diagram of a men's college lacrosse field]]
Field lacrosse is the men's outdoor version of the sport. There are ten players on each team: three attackmen, three midfielders, three defensemen, and one [[goaltender (field lacrosse)|goalie]]. Each player carries a [[lacrosse stick]]. A short stick measures between 40 and 42 inches (about 1 meter) long and is used by attackmen and midfielders. A maximum of four players on the field per team may carry a long stick which is between 52 and 72 inches (1.3 to 1.8 meters) long and is used by the three defensemen and sometimes one defensive midfielder. The goalie uses a stick with a head as wide as 12 inches (30 centimeters) that can be between 40 and 72 inches long.<ref name="equipment">{{cite web|title=Equipment for Boys' and Men's Lacrosse|url=https://www.uslacrosse.org/safety/equipment/player-equipment|publisher=US Lacrosse}}</ref>

The field of play is 110 by 60 yards (100 by 55 meters). The goals are 6&nbsp;ft by {{convert|6|ft|m|abbr=on}} and are {{convert|80|yd|m|abbr=on}} apart. Each goal sits inside a circular "crease", measuring {{convert|18|ft|m|abbr=on}} in diameter.<ref name="field">{{cite web|title=Field Diagrams|url=https://www.uslacrosse.org/rules/field-diagrams|publisher=US Lacrosse}}</ref> The goalie has special privileges within the crease to avoid opponents' stick checks. Offensive players or their sticks may not enter into the crease at any time. The mid-field line separates the field into an offensive and defensive zone for each team. Each team must keep four players in its defensive zone and three players in its offensive zone at all times. It does not matter which positional players satisfy the requirement, although usually the three attackmen stay in the offensive zone, the three defensemen and the goalie stay in the defensive zone, and the three middies play in both zones. A team that violates this rule is offsides and either loses possession of the ball if they have it or incurs a technical foul if they do not.<ref name=mensrules>{{cite web|url=https://www.uslacrosse.org/rules/mens-rules |title=Men's Rules |publisher=US Lacrosse}}</ref>

[[File:Face-off.jpg|thumb|left|A face-off]]
The regulation playing time of a game is 60 minutes, divided into four periods of 15 minutes each.<ref name=mensrules/> Play is started at the beginning of each quarter and after each goal with a [[Face-off#Field lacrosse|face-off]]. During a face-off, two players lay their sticks on the ground parallel to the mid-line, the two heads of their sticks on opposite sides of the ball. At the whistle, the face-off-men scrap for the ball, often by "clamping" it under their stick and flicking it out to their teammates. When one of the teams has possession of the ball, they bring it into their offensive zone and try to score a goal. Due to the offsides rule, settled play involves six offensive players versus six defensive players and a goalie.<ref name="basics">{{cite web|title=Getting started: Beginners Lacrosse 101|url=http://www.lacrosse.com/guide/getting-started-beginners-lacrosse-101/|website=Lacrosse.com}}</ref>

If the ball goes out of bounds, possession is awarded against the team that touched it last. The exception is when the ball is shot towards the goal. Missed shots that go out of bounds are awarded to the team that has the player who is the closest to the ball when and where the ball goes out. During play, teams may substitute players in and out if they leave and enter the field through the substitution area, sometimes referred to as "on the fly". After penalties and goals, players may freely substitute and do not have to go through the substitution area.<ref name=boysrules>{{cite web|url=https://www.uslacrosse.org/rules/boys-rules |title=Boys' Rules |publisher=US Lacrosse}}</ref>

Penalties are either technical or personal fouls. Personal fouls such as cross-checking, illegal body check or slashing, are about player safety. Cross-checking is when a player checks another player with their hands further than shoulder-width apart on the shaft. A slash is when a player swings his/her stick at another player uncontrollably, usually to the discretion of the referee. Even if he/she does not hit the player in possession, a flag can still be thrown. These fouls draw 1-minute or longer penalties; the offending player must leave the field and stay in the substitution area for the length of the penalty. Penalties are either releasable or non-releasable; releasable means that if a goal is scored by either team during the time that the penalty is served, the player serving the penalty can re-enter the play and both teams will once again have an equal number of players. Non-releasable means that the player must serve the entire time of the penalty, regardless of any goals scored. His team plays with nine players for the duration. Because of the offsides rule, this means the opponent plays with six attackers versus five defenders plus the goalie. Technical fouls, such as offsides, pushing, and holding, result in either a turnover or a 30-second penalty, depending on which team has the ball.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The team that has taken the penalty is said to be playing [[shorthanded|man down]], while the other team is [[Power play (sporting term)#Lacrosse|man up]]. Teams will use various [[lacrosse strategy|lacrosse strategies]] to attack and defend while a player is being penalized.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

===Box lacrosse===
{{Main|Box lacrosse}}

[[File:Box Lacrosse.jpg|thumb|A game of box lacrosse in the NLL.]]
Box lacrosse is played by teams of five runners plus a goalie on a [[Ice hockey rink|hockey rink]] where the ice has been removed or covered by artificial turf, or in an indoor soccer field. The enclosed playing area is called a box, in contrast to the open playing field of the traditional game.<ref name="lax-101">{{cite web| url = http://www.nll.com/about/box-lax-101/ | title = Box Lax 101| accessdate = November 15, 2017 | publisher = [[National Lacrosse League]]}}</ref> This version of the game was introduced in Canada in the 1930s to promote business for hockey arenas outside of the ice hockey season.<ref name=fisher>{{cite book |last= Fisher |first= Donald M. |year= 2002 |title= Lacrosse: A History of the Game |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=N8dQ11uQxrQC&lpg=PP1 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |isbn=0-8018-6938-2 |accessdate= }}</ref>{{rp|page=157}} Within several years it had nearly supplanted field lacrosse in Canada.<ref name=fisher />{{rp|page=120}}

The goals in box lacrosse are smaller than field lacrosse, traditionally {{convert|4|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide and tall.  Also, the [[Goaltender (box lacrosse)|goaltender]] wears much more protective padding, including a massive chest protector and armguard combination known as "uppers", large shin guards known as leg pads (both of which must follow strict measurement guidelines), and ice hockey-style goalie masks.<ref name="lax-101"/><ref name=Z4Laxx>{{cite web|url=http://www.zone4laxx.com/box_lacrosse_equipment_guideline.htm |title=Box Lacrosse Equipment Guideline |publisher=Zone4Laxx.com |accessdate=October 28, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121180039/http://www.zone4laxx.com/box_lacrosse_equipment_guideline.htm |archivedate=November 21, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}</ref>

The style of the game is quick, accelerated by the close confines of the floor and a [[shot clock]]. The shot clock requires the attacking team to take a shot on goal within 30 seconds of gaining possession of the ball.<ref name="lax-101"/> Box lacrosse is also a much more physical game. Since cross checking is legal in box lacrosse, players wear rib pads and the shoulder and elbow pads are bigger and stronger than what field lacrosse players wear. Box lacrosse players wear a hockey helmet with a box lacrosse cage. There is no offsides in box lacrosse, the players substitute freely from their bench areas as in hockey. However, most players specialize in offense or defense, so usually all five runners substitute for teammates as their team transitions between offense and defense.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

For penalties, the offending player is sent to the [[penalty box]] and his team has to play without him, or [[short handed|man-down]], for the length of the penalty. Most fouls are minor penalties and last for two minutes, major penalties for serious offenses last five minutes. What separates box lacrosse (and ice hockey) from other sports is that at the top levels of professional and junior lacrosse, participating in a fight does not automatically cause an ejection, but a five-minute major penalty is given.<ref name="lax-101"/>

Box lacrosse is played at the highest level in the [[National Lacrosse League]] and by the Senior A divisions of the [[Canadian Lacrosse Association]]. The National Lacrosse League (NLL) employs some minor rule changes from the Canadian Lacrosse Association (CLA) rules. Notably, the goals are 4’9" wide instead of 4&nbsp;ft and the games are played during the winter.<ref name=nllrule/><ref name="lax-101"/> The NLL games consist of four fifteen-minute quarters compared with three periods of twenty minutes each in CLA games. NLL players may only use sticks with hollow shafts, while CLA permits solid wooden sticks.<ref name=nllrule>{{cite web|url=http://www.nll.com/wp-content/uploads/NLL2017Rulebook.pdf |title=National Lacrosse League 2017 Official Rules |publisher=National Lacrosse League |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last= Vennum |first= Thomas |title= American Indian Lacrosse: Little Brother of War |publisher= Smithsonian Institution |year= 2002 |isbn= 978-1560983026 |page= 287}}</ref>

===Women's lacrosse===
[[File:2005 NCAA Women's Lacrosse Championship - Virginia Cavaliers vs Northwestern Wildcats.jpg|thumb|2005 [[NCAA Women's Lacrosse Championship]]]]
{{Main|Women's lacrosse}}
The rules of women's lacrosse differ significantly from men's lacrosse, most notably by equipment and the degree of allowable physical contact.<ref name="FIL women's rules">{{cite web|title=2015-2018 Women's Official Rules|url=https://filacrosse.com/wp-content/downloads/women/Rules/FIL_WomensRuleBookJuly2017GAONLINE_Aug2017.pdf|publisher=Federation of International Lacrosse|accessdate=November 15, 2017}}</ref> Women's lacrosse rules also differ significantly between the US and all other countries, who play by the Federation of International Lacrosse (FIL) rules. Women's lacrosse does not allow physical contact, the only protective equipment worn is a mouth guard and eye-guard. Recently,{{when|date=February 2018}} there has been discussion of requiring headgear to prevent concussions. Florida was the first state to mandate headgear in women's lacrosse in 2008.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.naplesnews.com/story/sports/high-school/lacrosse/2018/02/19/girls-lacrosse-fhsaa-hopes-helmets-cut-down-concussions/352069002/|title=Girls lacrosse: FHSAA hopes helmets will cut down on concussions|website=Naples Daily News|language=en|access-date=January 18, 2019}}</ref> Stick checking is permitted in the women's game, but only in certain levels of play and within strict rules. Women's lacrosse also does not allow players to have a pocket, or loose net, on the lacrosse stick. Women start the game with a "draw" instead of a face-off. The two players stand up and the ball is placed between their stick heads while their sticks are horizontal at waist-height. At the whistle, the players lift their sticks into the air, trying to control where the ball goes.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The first modern women's lacrosse game was held at [[St Leonards School]] in Scotland in 1890. It was introduced by the school's headmistress [[Louisa Lumsden]] after a visit to [[Quebec]], where she saw it played.<ref name=lumsden>{{cite web|url=http://www.stleonards-fife.org/Index.asp?MainID=4382 |title=History of Lacrosse at St Leonards |accessdate=May 1, 2008 |last= |first= |author2= |work=STLeonards-Fife.org |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506160603/http://www.stleonards-fife.org/Index.asp?MainID=4382 |archivedate=May 6, 2008 |df= }}</ref> The first women's lacrosse team in the United States was established at [[Bryn Mawr School]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]] in 1926. Men's and women's lacrosse were played under virtually the same rules, with no protective equipment, until the mid-1930s.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

[[File:Women's lacrosse.GIF|thumb|left|Women's lacrosse field diagram]]
Both the number of players and the lines on the field differ from men's lacrosse. There are 12 players in women's lacrosse and players must abide by certain boundaries that do not exist in men's play. The three specific boundaries are the 8-meter "fan" in front of the goal (11 meters internationally), the 12-meter (15 meters internationally) half circle that surrounds the 8-meter fan, and the draw circle in the center of the field, which is used for draws to start quarters and after goals. The goal circle is also positioned slightly closer to the end line in women's lacrosse compared to men's. In women's lacrosse on either the offensive or defensive end, the players besides the goaltender are not able to step inside the goal circle; this becomes a "goal-circle violation".  However, at the women's collegiate level, a new rule has been established that allows defenders to pass through the goal circle.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The 8-meter fan that is in front of the goal circle has a few restrictions in it. Defenders cannot stand inside the 8-meter fan longer than 3 seconds without being a stick-length away from the offensive player they are guarding. This is very similar to the 
[[three-second rule]] in basketball. A three seconds violation results in a player from the other team taking a free shot against the goalie. If you are an attacker trying to shoot the ball into the goal, you are not supposed to take a shot while a defender is in "shooting space." To make sure that you, the defender, are being safe, you want to lead with your [[lacrosse stick]] and once you are a sticks-length away, you can be in front of her.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uslacrosse.org/sites/default/files/public/documents/rules/2016-womens-rulebook.pdf |title=2016 Women's Rulebook |publisher=US Lacrosse |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}</ref>

===Intercrosse===
{{main|Intercrosse}}
Intercrosse, or soft stick lacrosse, is a non-contact form of lacrosse with a standardized set of rules using modified lacrosse equipment. An intercrosse stick is different from a normal lacrosse stick, the head is made completely of plastic instead of leather or nylon pockets in traditional lacrosse sticks. The ball is larger, softer and hollow, unlike a lacrosse ball, which is solid rubber.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Intercrosse as a competitive adult sport is popular in Quebec, Canada, as well as in many European countries, particularly in the Czech Republic.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Generally, teams consist of five players per side, and the field size is 20&nbsp;m wide and 40&nbsp;m long (65 by 130 feet). Goals for adults are the same size as [[box lacrosse]], 4 feet in height and width (1.2 x 1.2&nbsp;m). The international governing body, the Fédération Internationale d'Inter-Crosse, hosts a [[FIIC Intercrosse World Championship|World Championship]] bi-annually.<ref>{{cite web|title=World Cup / World Championship|url=http://inter-crosse.com/competitions/world-cup/|publisher=Fédération Internationale d’Inter-Crosse|accessdate=November 14, 2017}}</ref>

Soft stick lacrosse is a popular way to introduce youth to the sport.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Krome|first1=Paul|title=Soft Stick, Big Impact|url=https://www.uslacrosse.org/blog/soft-stick-big-impact|publisher=US Lacrosse|date=June 1, 2016}}</ref> It can be played outdoors or indoors and has a developed curriculum for [[physical education]] classes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Physical Education Curriculum|url=https://www.uslacrosse.org/coaches/physical-education-curriculum|publisher=US Lacrosse}}</ref> Youth goals are often small, semi-circular portable nets, as there is no goalie.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==International lacrosse==
{{Further|List of national lacrosse organizations}}

Lacrosse has historically been played for the most part in [[Lacrosse in Canada|Canada]] and the [[Lacrosse in the United States|United States]], with small but dedicated lacrosse communities in the [[Lacrosse in England|United]] [[Lacrosse in Scotland|Kingdom]] and [[Lacrosse in Australia|Australia]]. Recently, however, lacrosse has begun to flourish at the international level, with teams being established around the world, particularly in Europe and East Asia.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

===Federation of International Lacrosse===
{{main|Federation of International Lacrosse}}

In August 2008, the men's international governing body, the International Lacrosse Federation, merged with the women's, the International Federation of Women's Lacrosse Associations, to form the Federation of International Lacrosse (FIL). There are currently 62 members of the FIL.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://filacrosse.com/fil-members/ | title=FIL Members – Federation of International Lacrosse | date=January 2019}}</ref>

===Tournaments===
The FIL sponsors five world championship tournaments: the [[World Lacrosse Championship]] for men's field, the [[Women's Lacrosse World Cup]] for women's, the [[World Indoor Lacrosse Championship]] for box lacrosse, and the [[Under-19 World Lacrosse Championships]] for men and women. Each is held every four years.<ref>{{cite web|title=About FIL|url=https://filacrosse.com/fil/|publisher=Federation of International Lacrosse|accessdate=November 14, 2017}}</ref>

The World Lacrosse Championship (WLC) began in 1968 as a four-team invitational tournament sponsored by the International Lacrosse Federation. Until 1990, only the United States, Canada, England, and Australia had entered. With the expansion of the game internationally, the [[2014 World Lacrosse Championship]] was contested by 38 countries.<ref>{{cite press release |title=Record Field for 2014 FIL World Championship|url=http://worldlacrosse2014.com/news/020714_record_field_for_fil_world_championship|publisher=US Lacrosse|accessdate=November 14, 2017}}</ref> The WLC has been dominated by the United States.

==Equipment==
[[File:Womens lacrosse stick head 2.jpg|thumb|Women's lacrosse stick]]

===Stick===
{{main|Lacrosse stick}}
The lacrosse stick has two parts, the head and the shaft.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

There are three parts to the head: the scoop, sidewall, and pocket. The scoop is the top of the stick that affects picking up ground ball as well as passing and shooting. The sidewall is the side of the head that affects the depth of the head and the stiffness. The pocket is the leather or nylon mesh attached to the sidewalll and scoop. A wider pocket allows an easier time catching balls, but will also cause less ball control. A narrower pocket makes catching harder, but allows more ball retention and accuracy.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Shafts are usually made of hollow metal. They are octagonal, instead of round, in order to provide a better grip. Most are made of [[aluminum]], [[titanium]], [[scandium]], or alloys, but some shafts are made from other materials, including wood, plastic, carbon fiber, or [[fiberglass]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

Stick length, both shaft and head together, is governed by NCAA regulations, which require that men's sticks be from 40 to 42&nbsp;inches long for offensive players, 52 to 72&nbsp;inches long for defensemen, and 40 to 72&nbsp;inches long for goalies.<ref name=equipment />

Women's sticks must be an overall length of 35.5 - 43.25 inches. The head must be seven to nine inches wide and the top of the ball must remain above the side walls when dropped in the pocket. The goalkeeper's stick must be 35.5 - 48 inches long. The head of the goalie's stick can up to 12 inches wide and the pocket may be mesh.<ref>{{cite web|title=Equipment for Girls' and Women's Lacrosse|url=https://www.uslacrosse.org/safety/equipment/player-equipment#women|publisher=US Lacrosse}}</ref>

===Men's field protective equipment===
Men's field lacrosse protective equipment contains a pair of [[lacrosse glove|gloves]], elbow pads, shoulder pads, [[lacrosse helmet|helmet]], and mouthguard. Pads differ in size and protection from player to player based on position, ability, comfort and preference. For example, many attack players wear larger and more protective elbow pads to protect themselves from checks thrown at them while defenders typically wear smaller and less protective pads due to their smaller possibility of being checked and goalies usually wear no elbow pads due to the very limited opportunities of being checked. A goalkeeper must also wear a large protective chest pad to cover their stomach and chest and a plastic neck guard that connects to the chin of their helmet to protect them from shots hitting their windpipe. In addition, male goalkeepers are required to wear a protective cup.<ref name=equipment />

===Men's box protective equipment===
Men's box players wear more protective gear than field players due to the increased physical contact and more permissive checking rules. Cross-checking in the back is allowed by the rules. Runners wear larger and heavier elbow pads and stronger shoulder pads that extend down the back of the player. Most players wear rib pads as well. Box goalies wear equipment very similar to ice hockey goalies, the leg blockers are somewhat smaller, although the shoulder pads are bigger than ice hockey pads.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

===Women's field protective equipment===
Women's field players are not required to wear protective equipment besides eyegear and a mouthguard. Eyegear is a metal cage covering the eyes attached with a strap around the back of the head. In recent years, there has been discussion about allowing or requiring padded headgear to protect against concussions. Women goalies wear a helmet, gloves, and chest protector.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

'''Lacrosse''' is a [[team sport]] played with a [[lacrosse stick]] and a [[lacrosse ball]]. Players use the head of the lacrosse stick to carry, pass, catch, and shoot the ball into the goal.

The sport has four versions that have different sticks, fields, rules and equipment: [[field lacrosse]], [[women's lacrosse]], [[box lacrosse]] and [[intercrosse]]. The men's games, field lacrosse (outdoor) and box lacrosse (indoor), are contact sports and all players wear protective gear: [[lacrosse helmet|helmet]], [[lacrosse glove|gloves]], shoulder pads, and elbow pads. The women's game is played outdoors and does not allow body contact but does allow stick to stick contact. The only protective gear required for women players is eyegear, while goalies wear helmets and protective pads. Intercrosse is a mixed-gender non-contact sport played indoors that uses an all-plastic stick and a softer ball.

The sport is governed by the [[Federation of International Lacrosse]].

{{Main|History of lacrosse}}

Lacrosse is part of the cultural tradition of the [[Iroquois]] (''Haudenosaunee'') people, inhabiting what is now [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Pennsylvania]]. Lacrosse may have been developed as early as 1100 AD among indigenous peoples in [[North America]].<ref name=liss>{{cite book |last= Liss |first= Howard |title= Lacrosse |publisher= Funk & Wagnalls |year= 1970 |page= 13}}</ref> By the seventeenth century, it was well-established and was documented by [[Jesuit]] [[missionary]] priests in the territory of present-day Canada.<ref name=vennum>{{cite book |last= Vennum |first= Thomas |title= American Indian Lacrosse: Little Brother of War |publisher= Smithsonian Institution |year= 2002 |isbn= 978-1560983026}}{{page needed |date= May 2014}}</ref>

In the traditional [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|aboriginal Canadian]] version, each team consisted of about 100 to 1,000 men on a field that stretched from about {{convert|500|m|ft|abbr=on}} to {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on}} long.<ref name="STX">{{cite web|url=http://www.stxlacrosse.com/theculture/history.cfm |title=Lacrosse History |accessdate=February 24, 2007 |publisher=[[STX (sports manufacturer)|STX]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070524045912/http://www.stxlacrosse.com/theculture/history.cfm |archivedate=May 24, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}</ref> These games lasted from sunup to sundown for two to three days straight and were played as part of ceremonial ritual, a kind of symbolic warfare, or to give thanks to the Creator or Master.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Lacrosse played a significant role in the community and religious life of tribes across the continent for many years. Early lacrosse was characterized by deep spiritual involvement, befitting the spirit of combat in which it was undertaken. Those who took part did so in the role of [[warriors]], with the goal of bringing glory and honor to themselves and their tribes.<ref>{{cite news|last=Rock |first=Tom |title=More Than a Game |work=Lacrosse Magazine |publisher=[[US Lacrosse]] |date=November–December 2002 |url=http://redhawkslax.com/more-than-a-game-lacrosse-at-the-onondaga-nation-connects-the-current-generation-with-its-ancestors/ |accessdate=March 18, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070822224214/http://www.redhawkslax.com/news.lacrossemag.html |archivedate=August 22, 2007 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}</ref> The game was said to be played "for the Creator" or was referred to as "The Creator's Game."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.oneidaindiannation.com/lacrosse-the-creators-game/|title=Lacrosse, the Creator’s game|work=Oneida Indian Nation|access-date=September 9, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>

[[File:Ball players.jpg|left|thumb| ''Ball Players'' by George Catlin.]]
The French [[Jesuit missions in North America|Jesuit]] missionary [[Jean de Brébeuf]] saw [[Wyandot people|Huron]] tribesmen play the game during 1637 in present-day Ontario. He called it ''la crosse'', "the stick" in French.<ref name=CAencyclopedia /> The name seems to be originated from the French term for [[field hockey]], ''le jeu de la crosse''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.e-lacrosse.com/laxhist4.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19991008114420/http://www.e-lacrosse.com/laxhist4.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 8, 1999 |title=Lacrosse: E-Lacrosse Lacrosse History, Links and Sources |publisher=E-lacrosse.com |accessdate=February 25, 2011 }}</ref>

[[James Smith (frontiersman)|James Smith]] described in some detail a game being played in 1757 by [[Mohawk people]] "wherein now they used a wooden ball, about {{convert|3|in|cm|abbr=on|order=flip}} in diameter, and the instrument they moved it with was a strong staff about {{convert|5|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}} long, with a hoop net on the end of it, large enough to contain the ball."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/stream/accountofremarka00smit#page/76/mode/2up/ |title=An account of the remarkable occurrences in the life and travels of Colonel James Smith |work=Internet Archive |accessdate=November 8, 2017 |pages=77–78}}</ref>

Anglophones from Montreal noticed the game being played by [[Mohawk people]] and started playing themselves in the 1830s.<ref name=CAencyclopedia /> In 1856, [[William George Beers]], a Canadian dentist, founded the [[Montreal Lacrosse Club]].<ref name=filhistory>{{cite web|title=Origin & History|url=https://filacrosse.com/fil/origin-history/|publisher=Federation of International Lacrosse|accessdate=November 15, 2017 |editor=Claydon, Jane}}</ref> In 1860, Beers codified the game, shortening the length of each game and reducing the number of players to 12 per team.<ref name=CAencyclopedia>{{cite web |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/lacrosse/ |title=Lacrosse |work=The Canadian Encyclopedia |first=Barbara K. |last=Adamski}}</ref> The first game played under Beers's rules was at [[Upper Canada College]] in 1867; they lost to the [[Toronto Cricket Club]] by a score of 3–1.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

The new sport proved to be very popular and spread across the English-speaking world; [[List of the oldest lacrosse teams|by 1900 there were dozens of men's clubs]] in Canada, the United States, England, Australia, and New Zealand. The [[women's lacrosse#History|women's game was introduced]] by [[Louisa Lumsden]] in Scotland in 1890. The first women's club in the United States was started by [[Rosabelle Sinclair]] at [[Bryn Mawr School]] in 1926.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.brynmawrschool.org/page/about/history |title=History |publisher=Bryn Mawr School |accessdate=December 2, 2017}}</ref>

In the United States, lacrosse during the late 1800s and first half of the 1900s was primarily a regional sport centered around the [[Mid-Atlantic states]], especially [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Maryland]]. However, in the last half of the 20th century, the sport spread outside this region, and can be currently found in most of the United States. According to a survey conducted by [[US Lacrosse]] in 2016, there are over 825,000 lacrosse participants nationwide and lacrosse is the fastest-growing team sport among [[National Federation of State High School Associations|NFHS]] member schools.<ref name="participation">{{cite web|title=2016 Participation Survey|url=https://www.uslacrosse.org/sites/default/files/public/documents/about-us-lacrosse/participation-survey-2016.pdf|publisher=US Lacrosse}}</ref>

==Versions of lacrosse==

===Field lacrosse===
{{Main|Field lacrosse}}
[[File:Mens lacrosse diagram.svg|thumb|Diagram of a men's college lacrosse field]]
Field lacrosse is the men's outdoor version of the sport. There are ten players on each team: three attackmen, three midfielders, three defensemen, and one [[goaltender (field lacrosse)|goalie]]. Each player carries a [[lacrosse stick]]. A short stick measures between 40 and 42 inches (about 1 meter) long and is used by attackmen and midfielders. A maximum of four players on the field per team may carry a long stick which is between 52 and 72 inches (1.3 to 1.8 meters) long and is used by the three defensemen and sometimes one defensive midfielder. The goalie uses a stick with a head as wide as 12 inches (30 centimeters) that can be between 40 and 72 inches long.<ref name="equipment">{{cite web|title=Equipment for Boys' and Men's Lacrosse|url=https://www.uslacrosse.org/safety/equipment/player-equipment|publisher=US Lacrosse}}</ref>

The field of play is 110 by 60 yards (100 by 55 meters). The goals are 6&nbsp;ft by {{convert|6|ft|m|abbr=on}} and are {{convert|80|yd|m|abbr=on}} apart. Each goal sits inside a circular "crease", measuring {{convert|18|ft|m|abbr=on}} in diameter.<ref name="field">{{cite web|title=Field Diagrams|url=https://www.uslacrosse.org/rules/field-diagrams|publisher=US Lacrosse}}</ref> The goalie has special privileges within the crease to avoid opponents' stick checks. Offensive players or their sticks may not enter into the crease at any time. The mid-field line separates the field into an offensive and defensive zone for each team. Each team must keep four players in its defensive zone and three players in its offensive zone at all times. It does not matter which positional players satisfy the requirement, although usually the three attackmen stay in the offensive zone, the three defensemen and the goalie stay in the defensive zone, and the three middies play in both zones. A team that violates this rule is offsides and either loses possession of the ball if they have it or incurs a technical foul if they do not.<ref name=mensrules>{{cite web|url=https://www.uslacrosse.org/rules/mens-rules |title=Men's Rules |publisher=US Lacrosse}}</ref>

[[File:Face-off.jpg|thumb|left|A face-off]]
The regulation playing time of a game is 60 minutes, divided into four periods of 15 minutes each.<ref name=mensrules/> Play is started at the beginning of each quarter and after each goal with a [[Face-off#Field lacrosse|face-off]]. During a face-off, two players lay their sticks on the ground parallel to the mid-line, the two heads of their sticks on opposite sides of the ball. At the whistle, the face-off-men scrap for the ball, often by "clamping" it under their stick and flicking it out to their teammates. When one of the teams has possession of the ball, they bring it into their offensive zone and try to score a goal. Due to the offsides rule, settled play involves six offensive players versus six defensive players and a goalie.<ref name="basics">{{cite web|title=Getting started: Beginners Lacrosse 101|url=http://www.lacrosse.com/guide/getting-started-beginners-lacrosse-101/|website=Lacrosse.com}}</ref>

If the ball goes out of bounds, possession is awarded against the team that touched it last. The exception is when the ball is shot towards the goal. Missed shots that go out of bounds are awarded to the team that has the player who is the closest to the ball when and where the ball goes out. During play, teams may substitute players in and out if they leave and enter the field through the substitution area, sometimes referred to as "on the fly". After penalties and goals, players may freely substitute and do not have to go through the substitution area.<ref name=boysrules>{{cite web|url=https://www.uslacrosse.org/rules/boys-rules |title=Boys' Rules |publisher=US Lacrosse}}</ref>

Penalties are either technical or personal fouls. Personal fouls such as cross-checking, illegal body check or slashing, are about player safety. Cross-checking is when a player checks another player with their hands further than shoulder-width apart on the shaft. A slash is when a player swings his/her stick at another player uncontrollably, usually to the discretion of the referee. Even if he/she does not hit the player in possession, a flag can still be thrown. These fouls draw 1-minute or longer penalties; the offending player must leave the field and stay in the substitution area for the length of the penalty. Penalties are either releasable or non-releasable; releasable means that if a goal is scored by either team during the time that the penalty is served, the player serving the penalty can re-enter the play and both teams will once again have an equal number of players. Non-releasable means that the player must serve the entire time of the penalty, regardless of any goals scored. His team plays with nine players for the duration. Because of the offsides rule, this means the opponent plays with six attackers versus five defenders plus the goalie. Technical fouls, such as offsides, pushing, and holding, result in either a turnover or a 30-second penalty, depending on which team has the ball.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The team that has taken the penalty is said to be playing [[shorthanded|man down]], while the other team is [[Power play (sporting term)#Lacrosse|man up]]. Teams will use various [[lacrosse strategy|lacrosse strategies]] to attack and defend while a player is being penalized.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

===Box lacrosse===
{{Main|Box lacrosse}}

[[File:Box Lacrosse.jpg|thumb|A game of box lacrosse in the NLL.]]
Box lacrosse is played by teams of five runners plus a goalie on a [[Ice hockey rink|hockey rink]] where the ice has been removed or covered by artificial turf, or in an indoor soccer field. The enclosed playing area is called a box, in contrast to the open playing field of the traditional game.<ref name="lax-101">{{cite web| url = http://www.nll.com/about/box-lax-101/ | title = Box Lax 101| accessdate = November 15, 2017 | publisher = [[National Lacrosse League]]}}</ref> This version of the game was introduced in Canada in the 1930s to promote business for hockey arenas outside of the ice hockey season.<ref name=fisher>{{cite book |last= Fisher |first= Donald M. |year= 2002 |title= Lacrosse: A History of the Game |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=N8dQ11uQxrQC&lpg=PP1 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |isbn=0-8018-6938-2 |accessdate= }}</ref>{{rp|page=157}} Within several years it had nearly supplanted field lacrosse in Canada.<ref name=fisher />{{rp|page=120}}

The goals in box lacrosse are smaller than field lacrosse, traditionally {{convert|4|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide and tall.  Also, the [[Goaltender (box lacrosse)|goaltender]] wears much more protective padding, including a massive chest protector and armguard combination known as "uppers", large shin guards known as leg pads (both of which must follow strict measurement guidelines), and ice hockey-style goalie masks.<ref name="lax-101"/><ref name=Z4Laxx>{{cite web|url=http://www.zone4laxx.com/box_lacrosse_equipment_guideline.htm |title=Box Lacrosse Equipment Guideline |publisher=Zone4Laxx.com |accessdate=October 28, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121180039/http://www.zone4laxx.com/box_lacrosse_equipment_guideline.htm |archivedate=November 21, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}</ref>

The style of the game is quick, accelerated by the close confines of the floor and a [[shot clock]]. The shot clock requires the attacking team to take a shot on goal within 30 seconds of gaining possession of the ball.<ref name="lax-101"/> Box lacrosse is also a much more physical game. Since cross checking is legal in box lacrosse, players wear rib pads and the shoulder and elbow pads are bigger and stronger than what field lacrosse players wear. Box lacrosse players wear a hockey helmet with a box lacrosse cage. There is no offsides in box lacrosse, the players substitute freely from their bench areas as in hockey. However, most players specialize in offense or defense, so usually all five runners substitute for teammates as their team transitions between offense and defense.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

For penalties, the offending player is sent to the [[penalty box]] and his team has to play without him, or [[short handed|man-down]], for the length of the penalty. Most fouls are minor penalties and last for two minutes, major penalties for serious offenses last five minutes. What separates box lacrosse (and ice hockey) from other sports is that at the top levels of professional and junior lacrosse, participating in a fight does not automatically cause an ejection, but a five-minute major penalty is given.<ref name="lax-101"/>

Box lacrosse is played at the highest level in the [[National Lacrosse League]] and by the Senior A divisions of the [[Canadian Lacrosse Association]]. The National Lacrosse League (NLL) employs some minor rule changes from the Canadian Lacrosse Association (CLA) rules. Notably, the goals are 4’9" wide instead of 4&nbsp;ft and the games are played during the winter.<ref name=nllrule/><ref name="lax-101"/> The NLL games consist of four fifteen-minute quarters compared with three periods of twenty minutes each in CLA games. NLL players may only use sticks with hollow shafts, while CLA permits solid wooden sticks.<ref name=nllrule>{{cite web|url=http://www.nll.com/wp-content/uploads/NLL2017Rulebook.pdf |title=National Lacrosse League 2017 Official Rules |publisher=National Lacrosse League |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last= Vennum |first= Thomas |title= American Indian Lacrosse: Little Brother of War |publisher= Smithsonian Institution |year= 2002 |isbn= 978-1560983026 |page= 287}}</ref>

===Women's lacrosse===
[[File:2005 NCAA Women's Lacrosse Championship - Virginia Cavaliers vs Northwestern Wildcats.jpg|thumb|2005 [[NCAA Women's Lacrosse Championship]]]]
{{Main|Women's lacrosse}}
The rules of women's lacrosse differ significantly from men's lacrosse, most notably by equipment and the degree of allowable physical contact.<ref name="FIL women's rules">{{cite web|title=2015-2018 Women's Official Rules|url=https://filacrosse.com/wp-content/downloads/women/Rules/FIL_WomensRuleBookJuly2017GAONLINE_Aug2017.pdf|publisher=Federation of International Lacrosse|accessdate=November 15, 2017}}</ref> Women's lacrosse rules also differ significantly between the US and all other countries, who play by the Federation of International Lacrosse (FIL) rules. Women's lacrosse does not allow physical contact, the only protective equipment worn is a mouth guard and eye-guard. Recently,{{when|date=February 2018}} there has been discussion of requiring headgear to prevent concussions. Florida was the first state to mandate headgear in women's lacrosse in 2008.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.naplesnews.com/story/sports/high-school/lacrosse/2018/02/19/girls-lacrosse-fhsaa-hopes-helmets-cut-down-concussions/352069002/|title=Girls lacrosse: FHSAA hopes helmets will cut down on concussions|website=Naples Daily News|language=en|access-date=January 18, 2019}}</ref> Stick checking is permitted in the women's game, but only in certain levels of play and within strict rules. Women's lacrosse also does not allow players to have a pocket, or loose net, on the lacrosse stick. Women start the game with a "draw" instead of a face-off. The two players stand up and the ball is placed between their stick heads while their sticks are horizontal at waist-height. At the whistle, the players lift their sticks into the air, trying to control where the ball goes.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The first modern women's lacrosse game was held at [[St Leonards School]] in Scotland in 1890. It was introduced by the school's headmistress [[Louisa Lumsden]] after a visit to [[Quebec]], where she saw it played.<ref name=lumsden>{{cite web|url=http://www.stleonards-fife.org/Index.asp?MainID=4382 |title=History of Lacrosse at St Leonards |accessdate=May 1, 2008 |last= |first= |author2= |work=STLeonards-Fife.org |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506160603/http://www.stleonards-fife.org/Index.asp?MainID=4382 |archivedate=May 6, 2008 |df= }}</ref> The first women's lacrosse team in the United States was established at [[Bryn Mawr School]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]] in 1926. Men's and women's lacrosse were played under virtually the same rules, with no protective equipment, until the mid-1930s.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

[[File:Women's lacrosse.GIF|thumb|left|Women's lacrosse field diagram]]
Both the number of players and the lines on the field differ from men's lacrosse. There are 12 players in women's lacrosse and players must abide by certain boundaries that do not exist in men's play. The three specific boundaries are the 8-meter "fan" in front of the goal (11 meters internationally), the 12-meter (15 meters internationally) half circle that surrounds the 8-meter fan, and the draw circle in the center of the field, which is used for draws to start quarters and after goals. The goal circle is also positioned slightly closer to the end line in women's lacrosse compared to men's. In women's lacrosse on either the offensive or defensive end, the players besides the goaltender are not able to step inside the goal circle; this becomes a "goal-circle violation".  However, at the women's collegiate level, a new rule has been established that allows defenders to pass through the goal circle.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The 8-meter fan that is in front of the goal circle has a few restrictions in it. Defenders cannot stand inside the 8-meter fan longer than 3 seconds without being a stick-length away from the offensive player they are guarding. This is very similar to the 
[[three-second rule]] in basketball. A three seconds violation results in a player from the other team taking a free shot against the goalie. If you are an attacker trying to shoot the ball into the goal, you are not supposed to take a shot while a defender is in "shooting space." To make sure that you, the defender, are being safe, you want to lead with your [[lacrosse stick]] and once you are a sticks-length away, you can be in front of her.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uslacrosse.org/sites/default/files/public/documents/rules/2016-womens-rulebook.pdf |title=2016 Women's Rulebook |publisher=US Lacrosse |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}</ref>

===Intercrosse===
{{main|Intercrosse}}
Intercrosse, or soft stick lacrosse, is a non-contact form of lacrosse with a standardized set of rules using modified lacrosse equipment. An intercrosse stick is different from a normal lacrosse stick, the head is made completely of plastic instead of leather or nylon pockets in traditional lacrosse sticks. The ball is larger, softer and hollow, unlike a lacrosse ball, which is solid rubber.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Intercrosse as a competitive adult sport is popular in Quebec, Canada, as well as in many European countries, particularly in the Czech Republic.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Generally, teams consist of five players per side, and the field size is 20&nbsp;m wide and 40&nbsp;m long (65 by 130 feet). Goals for adults are the same size as [[box lacrosse]], 4 feet in height and width (1.2 x 1.2&nbsp;m). The international governing body, the Fédération Internationale d'Inter-Crosse, hosts a [[FIIC Intercrosse World Championship|World Championship]] bi-annually.<ref>{{cite web|title=World Cup / World Championship|url=http://inter-crosse.com/competitions/world-cup/|publisher=Fédération Internationale d’Inter-Crosse|accessdate=November 14, 2017}}</ref>

Soft stick lacrosse is a popular way to introduce youth to the sport.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Krome|first1=Paul|title=Soft Stick, Big Impact|url=https://www.uslacrosse.org/blog/soft-stick-big-impact|publisher=US Lacrosse|date=June 1, 2016}}</ref> It can be played outdoors or indoors and has a developed curriculum for [[physical education]] classes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Physical Education Curriculum|url=https://www.uslacrosse.org/coaches/physical-education-curriculum|publisher=US Lacrosse}}</ref> Youth goals are often small, semi-circular portable nets, as there is no goalie.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==International lacrosse==
{{Further|List of national lacrosse organizations}}

Lacrosse has historically been played for the most part in [[Lacrosse in Canada|Canada]] and the [[Lacrosse in the United States|United States]], with small but dedicated lacrosse communities in the [[Lacrosse in England|United]] [[Lacrosse in Scotland|Kingdom]] and [[Lacrosse in Australia|Australia]]. Recently, however, lacrosse has begun to flourish at the international level, with teams being established around the world, particularly in Europe and East Asia.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

===Federation of International Lacrosse===
{{main|Federation of International Lacrosse}}

In August 2008, the men's international governing body, the International Lacrosse Federation, merged with the women's, the International Federation of Women's Lacrosse Associations, to form the Federation of International Lacrosse (FIL). There are currently 62 members of the FIL.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://filacrosse.com/fil-members/ | title=FIL Members – Federation of International Lacrosse | date=January 2019}}</ref>

===Tournaments===
The FIL sponsors five world championship tournaments: the [[World Lacrosse Championship]] for men's field, the [[Women's Lacrosse World Cup]] for women's, the [[World Indoor Lacrosse Championship]] for box lacrosse, and the [[Under-19 World Lacrosse Championships]] for men and women. Each is held every four years.<ref>{{cite web|title=About FIL|url=https://filacrosse.com/fil/|publisher=Federation of International Lacrosse|accessdate=November 14, 2017}}</ref>

The World Lacrosse Championship (WLC) began in 1968 as a four-team invitational tournament sponsored by the International Lacrosse Federation. Until 1990, only the United States, Canada, England, and Australia had entered. With the expansion of the game internationally, the [[2014 World Lacrosse Championship]] was contested by 38 countries.<ref>{{cite press release |title=Record Field for 2014 FIL World Championship|url=http://worldlacrosse2014.com/news/020714_record_field_for_fil_world_championship|publisher=US Lacrosse|accessdate=November 14, 2017}}</ref> The WLC has been dominated by the United States. [[United States men's national lacrosse team|Team USA]] has won 9 of the 12 titles, with [[Canada men's national lacrosse team|Canada]] winning the other three.<ref>{{cite web|title=World Championship History|url=https://teamusa.uslacrosse.org/us-men/us-men-history|publisher=US Lacrosse|accessdate=November 14, 2017}}</ref>

The Women's Lacrosse World Cup (WLWC) began in 1982. The [[United States women's national lacrosse team|United States]] has won 8 of the 10 titles, with [[Australia women's national lacrosse team|Australia]] winning the other two. Canada and [[England women's national lacrosse team|England]] have always finished in the top five.

The [[2003 World Indoor Lacrosse Championship|first World Indoor Lacrosse Championship]] (WILC) was held in 2003 and contested by six nations at four sites in [[Ontario]].

An obstacle for lacrosse to return to the Olympics is insufficient international participation.

Lacrosse is played on all six continents, but the most recent world championships have involved 38 men's teams and 25 women's teams.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==Equipment==
[[File:Womens lacrosse stick head 2.jpg|thumb|Women's lacrosse stick]]

===Stick===
{{main|Lacrosse stick}}
The lacrosse stick has two parts, the head and the shaft.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

There are three parts to the head: the scoop, sidewall, and pocket. The scoop is the top of the stick that affects picking up ground ball as well as passing and shooting. The sidewall is the side of the head that affects the depth of the head and the stiffness. The pocket is the leather or nylon mesh attached to the sidewalll and scoop. A wider pocket allows an easier time catching balls, but will also cause less ball control. A narrower pocket makes catching harder, but allows more ball retention and accuracy.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Shafts are usually made of hollow metal. They are octagonal, instead of round, in order to provide a better grip. Most are made of [[aluminum]], [[titanium]], [[scandium]], or alloys, but some shafts are made from other materials, including wood, plastic, carbon fiber, or [[fiberglass]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

Stick length, both shaft and head together, is governed by NCAA regulations, which require that men's sticks be from 40 to 42&nbsp;inches long for offensive players, 52 to 72&nbsp;inches long for defensemen, and 40 to 72&nbsp;inches long for goalies.<ref name=equipment />

Women's sticks must be an overall length of 35.5 - 43.25 inches. The head must be seven to nine inches wide and the top of the ball must remain above the side walls when dropped in the pocket. The goalkeeper's stick must be 35.5 - 48 inches long. The head of the goalie's stick can up to 12 inches wide and the pocket may be mesh.<ref>{{cite web|title=Equipment for Girls' and Women's Lacrosse|url=https://www.uslacrosse.org/safety/equipment/player-equipment#women|publisher=US Lacrosse}}</ref>

===Men's field protective equipment===
Men's field lacrosse protective equipment contains a pair of [[lacrosse glove|gloves]], elbow pads, shoulder pads, [[lacrosse helmet|helmet]], and mouthguard. Pads differ in size and protection from player to player based on position, ability, comfort and preference. For example, many attack players wear larger and more protective elbow pads to protect themselves from checks thrown at them while defenders typically wear smaller and less protective pads due to their smaller possibility of being checked and goalies usually wear no elbow pads due to the very limited opportunities of being checked. A goalkeeper must also wear a large protective chest pad to cover their stomach and chest and a plastic neck guard that connects to the chin of their helmet to protect them from shots hitting their windpipe. In addition, male goalkeepers are required to wear a protective cup.<ref name=equipment />

===Men's box protective equipment===
Men's box players wear more protective gear than field players due to the increased physical contact and more permissive checking rules. Cross-checking in the back is allowed by the rules. Runners wear larger and heavier elbow pads and stronger shoulder pads that extend down the back of the player. Most players wear rib pads as well. Box goalies wear equipment very similar to ice hockey goalies, the leg blockers are somewhat smaller, although the shoulder pads are bigger than ice hockey pads.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

===Women's field protective equipment===
Women's field players are not required to wear protective equipment besides eyegear and a mouthguard. Eyegear is a metal cage covering the eyes attached with a strap around the back of the head. In recent years, there has been discussion about allowing or requiring padded headgear to protect against concussions. Women goalies wear a helmet, gloves, and chest protector.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

'''Lacrosse''' is a [[team sport]] played with a [[lacrosse stick]] and a [[lacrosse ball]]. Players use the head of the lacrosse stick to carry, pass, catch, and shoot the ball into the goal.

The sport has four versions that have different sticks, fields, rules and equipment: [[field lacrosse]], [[women's lacrosse]], [[box lacrosse]] and [[intercrosse]]. The men's games, field lacrosse (outdoor) and box lacrosse (indoor), are contact sports and all players wear protective gear: [[lacrosse helmet|helmet]], [[lacrosse glove|gloves]], shoulder pads, and elbow pads. The women's game is played outdoors and does not allow body contact but does allow stick to stick contact. The only protective gear required for women players is eyegear, while goalies wear helmets and protective pads. Intercrosse is a mixed-gender non-contact sport played indoors that uses an all-plastic stick and a softer ball.

{{Main|History of lacrosse}}

Lacrosse is part of the cultural tradition of the [[Iroquois]] (''Haudenosaunee'') people, inhabiting what is now [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Pennsylvania]]. Lacrosse may have been developed as early as 1100 AD among indigenous peoples in [[North America]].<ref name=liss>{{cite book |last= Liss |first= Howard |title= Lacrosse |publisher= Funk & Wagnalls |year= 1970 |page= 13}}</ref> By the seventeenth century, it was well-established and was documented by [[Jesuit]] [[missionary]] priests in the territory of present-day Canada.<ref name=vennum>{{cite book |last= Vennum |first= Thomas |title= American Indian Lacrosse: Little Brother of War |publisher= Smithsonian Institution |year= 2002 |isbn= 978-1560983026}}{{page needed |date= May 2014}}</ref>

In the traditional [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|aboriginal Canadian]] version, each team consisted of about 100 to 1,000 men on a field that stretched from about {{convert|500|m|ft|abbr=on}} to {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on}} long.<ref name="STX">{{cite web|url=http://www.stxlacrosse.com/theculture/history.cfm |title=Lacrosse History |accessdate=February 24, 2007 |publisher=[[STX (sports manufacturer)|STX]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070524045912/http://www.stxlacrosse.com/theculture/history.cfm |archivedate=May 24, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}</ref> These games lasted from sunup to sundown for two to three days straight and were played as part of ceremonial ritual, a kind of symbolic warfare, or to give thanks to the Creator or Master.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Lacrosse played a significant role in the community and religious life of tribes across the continent for many years. Early lacrosse was characterized by deep spiritual involvement, befitting the spirit of combat in which it was undertaken. Those who took part did so in the role of [[warriors]], with the goal of bringing glory and honor to themselves and their tribes.<ref>{{cite news|last=Rock |first=Tom |title=More Than a Game |work=Lacrosse Magazine |publisher=[[US Lacrosse]] |date=November–December 2002 |url=http://redhawkslax.com/more-than-a-game-lacrosse-at-the-onondaga-nation-connects-the-current-generation-with-its-ancestors/ |accessdate=March 18, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070822224214/http://www.redhawkslax.com/news.lacrossemag.html |archivedate=August 22, 2007 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}</ref> The game was said to be played "for the Creator" or was referred to as "The Creator's Game."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.oneidaindiannation.com/lacrosse-the-creators-game/|title=Lacrosse, the Creator’s game|work=Oneida Indian Nation|access-date=September 9, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>

[[File:Ball players.jpg|left|thumb| ''Ball Players'' by George Catlin.]]
The French [[Jesuit missions in North America|Jesuit]] missionary [[Jean de Brébeuf]] saw [[Wyandot people|Huron]] tribesmen play the game during 1637 in present-day Ontario. He called it ''la crosse'', "the stick" in French.<ref name=CAencyclopedia /> The name seems to be originated from the French term for [[field hockey]], ''le jeu de la crosse''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.e-lacrosse.com/laxhist4.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19991008114420/http://www.e-lacrosse.com/laxhist4.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 8, 1999 |title=Lacrosse: E-Lacrosse Lacrosse History, Links and Sources |publisher=E-lacrosse.com |accessdate=February 25, 2011 }}</ref>

[[James Smith (frontiersman)|James Smith]] described in some detail a game being played in 1757 by [[Mohawk people]] "wherein now they used a wooden ball, about {{convert|3|in|cm|abbr=on|order=flip}} in diameter, and the instrument they moved it with was a strong staff about {{convert|5|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}} long, with a hoop net on the end of it, large enough to contain the ball."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/stream/accountofremarka00smit#page/76/mode/2up/ |title=An account of the remarkable occurrences in the life and travels of Colonel James Smith |work=Internet Archive |accessdate=November 8, 2017 |pages=77–78}}</ref>

Anglophones from Montreal noticed the game being played by [[Mohawk people]] and started playing themselves in the 1830s.<ref name=CAencyclopedia /> In 1856, [[William George Beers]], a Canadian dentist, founded the [[Montreal Lacrosse Club]].<ref name=filhistory>{{cite web|title=Origin & History|url=https://filacrosse.com/fil/origin-history/|publisher=Federation of International Lacrosse|accessdate=November 15, 2017 |editor=Claydon, Jane}}</ref> In 1860, Beers codified the game, shortening the length of each game and reducing the number of players to 12 per team.<ref name=CAencyclopedia>{{cite web |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/lacrosse/ |title=Lacrosse |work=The Canadian Encyclopedia |first=Barbara K. |last=Adamski}}</ref> The first game played under Beers's rules was at [[Upper Canada College]] in 1867; they lost to the [[Toronto Cricket Club]] by a score of 3–1.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

The new sport proved to be very popular and spread across the English-speaking world; [[List of the oldest lacrosse teams|by 1900 there were dozens of men's clubs]] in Canada, the United States, England, Australia, and New Zealand. The [[women's lacrosse#History|women's game was introduced]] by [[Louisa Lumsden]] in Scotland in 1890. The first women's club in the United States was started by [[Rosabelle Sinclair]] at [[Bryn Mawr School]] in 1926.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.brynmawrschool.org/page/about/history |title=History |publisher=Bryn Mawr School |accessdate=December 2, 2017}}</ref>

In the United States, lacrosse during the late 1800s and first half of the 1900s was primarily a regional sport centered around the [[Mid-Atlantic states]], especially [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Maryland]]. However, in the last half of the 20th century, the sport spread outside this region, and can be currently found in most of the United States. According to a survey conducted by [[US Lacrosse]] in 2016, there are over 825,000 lacrosse participants nationwide and lacrosse is the fastest-growing team sport among [[National Federation of State High School Associations|NFHS]] member schools.<ref name="participation">{{cite web|title=2016 Participation Survey|url=https://www.uslacrosse.org/sites/default/files/public/documents/about-us-lacrosse/participation-survey-2016.pdf|publisher=US Lacrosse}}</ref>

==Versions of lacrosse==

===Field lacrosse===
{{Main|Field lacrosse}}
[[File:Mens lacrosse diagram.svg|thumb|Diagram of a men's college lacrosse field]]
Field lacrosse is the men's outdoor version of the sport. There are ten players on each team: three attackmen, three midfielders, three defensemen, and one [[goaltender (field lacrosse)|goalie]]. Each player carries a [[lacrosse stick]]. A short stick measures between 40 and 42 inches (about 1 meter) long and is used by attackmen and midfielders. A maximum of four players on the field per team may carry a long stick which is between 52 and 72 inches (1.3 to 1.8 meters) long and is used by the three defensemen and sometimes one defensive midfielder. The goalie uses a stick with a head as wide as 12 inches (30 centimeters) that can be between 40 and 72 inches long.<ref name="equipment">{{cite web|title=Equipment for Boys' and Men's Lacrosse|url=https://www.uslacrosse.org/safety/equipment/player-equipment|publisher=US Lacrosse}}</ref>

The field of play is 110 by 60 yards (100 by 55 meters). The goals are 6&nbsp;ft by {{convert|6|ft|m|abbr=on}} and are {{convert|80|yd|m|abbr=on}} apart. Each goal sits inside a circular "crease", measuring {{convert|18|ft|m|abbr=on}} in diameter.<ref name="field">{{cite web|title=Field Diagrams|url=https://www.uslacrosse.org/rules/field-diagrams|publisher=US Lacrosse}}</ref> The goalie has special privileges within the crease to avoid opponents' stick checks. Offensive players or their sticks may not enter into the crease at any time. The mid-field line separates the field into an offensive and defensive zone for each team. Each team must keep four players in its defensive zone and three players in its offensive zone at all times. It does not matter which positional players satisfy the requirement, although usually the three attackmen stay in the offensive zone, the three defensemen and the goalie stay in the defensive zone, and the three middies play in both zones. A team that violates this rule is offsides and either loses possession of the ball if they have it or incurs a technical foul if they do not.<ref name=mensrules>{{cite web|url=https://www.uslacrosse.org/rules/mens-rules |title=Men's Rules |publisher=US Lacrosse}}</ref>

[[File:Face-off.jpg|thumb|left|A face-off]]
The regulation playing time of a game is 60 minutes, divided into four periods of 15 minutes each.<ref name=mensrules/> Play is started at the beginning of each quarter and after each goal with a [[Face-off#Field lacrosse|face-off]]. During a face-off, two players lay their sticks on the ground parallel to the mid-line, the two heads of their sticks on opposite sides of the ball. At the whistle, the face-off-men scrap for the ball, often by "clamping" it under their stick and flicking it out to their teammates. When one of the teams has possession of the ball, they bring it into their offensive zone and try to score a goal. Due to the offsides rule, settled play involves six offensive players versus six defensive players and a goalie.<ref name="basics">{{cite web|title=Getting started: Beginners Lacrosse 101|url=http://www.lacrosse.com/guide/getting-started-beginners-lacrosse-101/|website=Lacrosse.com}}</ref>

If the ball goes out of bounds, possession is awarded against the team that touched it last. The exception is when the ball is shot towards the goal. Missed shots that go out of bounds are awarded to the team that has the player who is the closest to the ball when and where the ball goes out. During play, teams may substitute players in and out if they leave and enter the field through the substitution area, sometimes referred to as "on the fly". After penalties and goals, players may freely substitute and do not have to go through the substitution area.<ref name=boysrules>{{cite web|url=https://www.uslacrosse.org/rules/boys-rules |title=Boys' Rules |publisher=US Lacrosse}}</ref>

Penalties are either technical or personal fouls. Personal fouls such as cross-checking, illegal body check or slashing, are about player safety. Cross-checking is when a player checks another player with their hands further than shoulder-width apart on the shaft. A slash is when a player swings his/her stick at another player uncontrollably, usually to the discretion of the referee. Even if he/she does not hit the player in possession, a flag can still be thrown. These fouls draw 1-minute or longer penalties; the offending player must leave the field and stay in the substitution area for the length of the penalty. Penalties are either releasable or non-releasable; releasable means that if a goal is scored by either team during the time that the penalty is served, the player serving the penalty can re-enter the play and both teams will once again have an equal number of players. Non-releasable means that the player must serve the entire time of the penalty, regardless of any goals scored. His team plays with nine players for the duration. Because of the offsides rule, this means the opponent plays with six attackers versus five defenders plus the goalie. Technical fouls, such as offsides, pushing, and holding, result in either a turnover or a 30-second penalty, depending on which team has the ball.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The team that has taken the penalty is said to be playing [[shorthanded|man down]], while the other team is [[Power play (sporting term)#Lacrosse|man up]]. Teams will use various [[lacrosse strategy|lacrosse strategies]] to attack and defend while a player is being penalized.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

===Box lacrosse===
{{Main|Box lacrosse}}

[[File:Box Lacrosse.jpg|thumb|A game of box lacrosse in the NLL.]]
Box lacrosse is played by teams of five runners plus a goalie on a [[Ice hockey rink|hockey rink]] where the ice has been removed or covered by artificial turf, or in an indoor soccer field. The enclosed playing area is called a box, in contrast to the open playing field of the traditional game.<ref name="lax-101">{{cite web| url = http://www.nll.com/about/box-lax-101/ | title = Box Lax 101| accessdate = November 15, 2017 | publisher = [[National Lacrosse League]]}}</ref> This version of the game was introduced in Canada in the 1930s to promote business for hockey arenas outside of the ice hockey season.<ref name=fisher>{{cite book |last= Fisher |first= Donald M. |year= 2002 |title= Lacrosse: A History of the Game |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=N8dQ11uQxrQC&lpg=PP1 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |isbn=0-8018-6938-2 |accessdate= }}</ref>{{rp|page=157}} Within several years it had nearly supplanted field lacrosse in Canada.<ref name=fisher />{{rp|page=120}}

The goals in box lacrosse are smaller than field lacrosse, traditionally {{convert|4|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide and tall.  Also, the [[Goaltender (box lacrosse)|goaltender]] wears much more protective padding, including a massive chest protector and armguard combination known as "uppers", large shin guards known as leg pads (both of which must follow strict measurement guidelines), and ice hockey-style goalie masks.<ref name="lax-101"/><ref name=Z4Laxx>{{cite web|url=http://www.zone4laxx.com/box_lacrosse_equipment_guideline.htm |title=Box Lacrosse Equipment Guideline |publisher=Zone4Laxx.com |accessdate=October 28, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121180039/http://www.zone4laxx.com/box_lacrosse_equipment_guideline.htm |archivedate=November 21, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}</ref>

The style of the game is quick, accelerated by the close confines of the floor and a [[shot clock]]. The shot clock requires the attacking team to take a shot on goal within 30 seconds of gaining possession of the ball.<ref name="lax-101"/> Box lacrosse is also a much more physical game. Since cross checking is legal in box lacrosse, players wear rib pads and the shoulder and elbow pads are bigger and stronger than what field lacrosse players wear. Box lacrosse players wear a hockey helmet with a box lacrosse cage. There is no offsides in box lacrosse, the players substitute freely from their bench areas as in hockey. However, most players specialize in offense or defense, so usually all five runners substitute for teammates as their team transitions between offense and defense.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

For penalties, the offending player is sent to the [[penalty box]] and his team has to play without him, or [[short handed|man-down]], for the length of the penalty. Most fouls are minor penalties and last for two minutes, major penalties for serious offenses last five minutes. What separates box lacrosse (and ice hockey) from other sports is that at the top levels of professional and junior lacrosse, participating in a fight does not automatically cause an ejection, but a five-minute major penalty is given.<ref name="lax-101"/>

Box lacrosse is played at the highest level in the [[National Lacrosse League]] and by the Senior A divisions of the [[Canadian Lacrosse Association]]. The National Lacrosse League (NLL) employs some minor rule changes from the Canadian Lacrosse Association (CLA) rules. Notably, the goals are 4’9" wide instead of 4&nbsp;ft and the games are played during the winter.<ref name=nllrule/><ref name="lax-101"/> The NLL games consist of four fifteen-minute quarters compared with three periods of twenty minutes each in CLA games. NLL players may only use sticks with hollow shafts, while CLA permits solid wooden sticks.<ref name=nllrule>{{cite web|url=http://www.nll.com/wp-content/uploads/NLL2017Rulebook.pdf |title=National Lacrosse League 2017 Official Rules |publisher=National Lacrosse League |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last= Vennum |first= Thomas |title= American Indian Lacrosse: Little Brother of War |publisher= Smithsonian Institution |year= 2002 |isbn= 978-1560983026 |page= 287}}</ref>

===Women's lacrosse===
[[File:2005 NCAA Women's Lacrosse Championship - Virginia Cavaliers vs Northwestern Wildcats.jpg|thumb|2005 [[NCAA Women's Lacrosse Championship]]]]
{{Main|Women's lacrosse}}
The rules of women's lacrosse differ significantly from men's lacrosse, most notably by equipment and the degree of allowable physical contact.<ref name="FIL women's rules">{{cite web|title=2015-2018 Women's Official Rules|url=https://filacrosse.com/wp-content/downloads/women/Rules/FIL_WomensRuleBookJuly2017GAONLINE_Aug2017.pdf|publisher=Federation of International Lacrosse|accessdate=November 15, 2017}}</ref> Women's lacrosse rules also differ significantly between the US and all other countries, who play by the Federation of International Lacrosse (FIL) rules. Women's lacrosse does not allow physical contact, the only protective equipment worn is a mouth guard and eye-guard. Recently,{{when|date=February 2018}} there has been discussion of requiring headgear to prevent concussions. Florida was the first state to mandate headgear in women's lacrosse in 2008.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.naplesnews.com/story/sports/high-school/lacrosse/2018/02/19/girls-lacrosse-fhsaa-hopes-helmets-cut-down-concussions/352069002/|title=Girls lacrosse: FHSAA hopes helmets will cut down on concussions|website=Naples Daily News|language=en|access-date=January 18, 2019}}</ref> Stick checking is permitted in the women's game, but only in certain levels of play and within strict rules. Women's lacrosse also does not allow players to have a pocket, or loose net, on the lacrosse stick. Women start the game with a "draw" instead of a face-off. The two players stand up and the ball is placed between their stick heads while their sticks are horizontal at waist-height. At the whistle, the players lift their sticks into the air, trying to control where the ball goes.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The first modern women's lacrosse game was held at [[St Leonards School]] in Scotland in 1890. It was introduced by the school's headmistress [[Louisa Lumsden]] after a visit to [[Quebec]], where she saw it played.<ref name=lumsden>{{cite web|url=http://www.stleonards-fife.org/Index.asp?MainID=4382 |title=History of Lacrosse at St Leonards |accessdate=May 1, 2008 |last= |first= |author2= |work=STLeonards-Fife.org |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506160603/http://www.stleonards-fife.org/Index.asp?MainID=4382 |archivedate=May 6, 2008 |df= }}</ref> The first women's lacrosse team in the United States was established at [[Bryn Mawr School]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]] in 1926. Men's and women's lacrosse were played under virtually the same rules, with no protective equipment, until the mid-1930s.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

[[File:Women's lacrosse.GIF|thumb|left|Women's lacrosse field diagram]]
Both the number of players and the lines on the field differ from men's lacrosse. There are 12 players in women's lacrosse and players must abide by certain boundaries that do not exist in men's play. The three specific boundaries are the 8-meter "fan" in front of the goal (11 meters internationally), the 12-meter (15 meters internationally) half circle that surrounds the 8-meter fan, and the draw circle in the center of the field, which is used for draws to start quarters and after goals. The goal circle is also positioned slightly closer to the end line in women's lacrosse compared to men's. In women's lacrosse on either the offensive or defensive end, the players besides the goaltender are not able to step inside the goal circle; this becomes a "goal-circle violation".  However, at the women's collegiate level, a new rule has been established that allows defenders to pass through the goal circle.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The 8-meter fan that is in front of the goal circle has a few restrictions in it. Defenders cannot stand inside the 8-meter fan longer than 3 seconds without being a stick-length away from the offensive player they are guarding. This is very similar to the 
[[three-second rule]] in basketball. A three seconds violation results in a player from the other team taking a free shot against the goalie. If you are an attacker trying to shoot the ball into the goal, you are not supposed to take a shot while a defender is in "shooting space." To make sure that you, the defender, are being safe, you want to lead with your [[lacrosse stick]] and once you are a sticks-length away, you can be in front of her.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uslacrosse.org/sites/default/files/public/documents/rules/2016-womens-rulebook.pdf |title=2016 Women's Rulebook |publisher=US Lacrosse |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}</ref>

===Intercrosse===
{{main|Intercrosse}}
Intercrosse, or soft stick lacrosse, is a non-contact form of lacrosse with a standardized set of rules using modified lacrosse equipment. An intercrosse stick is different from a normal lacrosse stick, the head is made completely of plastic instead of leather or nylon pockets in traditional lacrosse sticks. The ball is larger, softer and hollow, unlike a lacrosse ball, which is solid rubber.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Intercrosse as a competitive adult sport is popular in Quebec, Canada, as well as in many European countries, particularly in the Czech Republic.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Generally, teams consist of five players per side, and the field size is 20&nbsp;m wide and 40&nbsp;m long (65 by 130 feet). Goals for adults are the same size as [[box lacrosse]], 4 feet in height and width (1.2 x 1.2&nbsp;m). The international governing body, the Fédération Internationale d'Inter-Crosse, hosts a [[FIIC Intercrosse World Championship|World Championship]] bi-annually.<ref>{{cite web|title=World Cup / World Championship|url=http://inter-crosse.com/competitions/world-cup/|publisher=Fédération Internationale d’Inter-Crosse|accessdate=November 14, 2017}}</ref>

Soft stick lacrosse is a popular way to introduce youth to the sport.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Krome|first1=Paul|title=Soft Stick, Big Impact|url=https://www.uslacrosse.org/blog/soft-stick-big-impact|publisher=US Lacrosse|date=June 1, 2016}}</ref> It can be played outdoors or indoors and has a developed curriculum for [[physical education]] classes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Physical Education Curriculum|url=https://www.uslacrosse.org/coaches/physical-education-curriculum|publisher=US Lacrosse}}</ref> Youth goals are often small, semi-circular portable nets, as there is no goalie.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==International lacrosse==
{{Further|List of national lacrosse organizations}}

Lacrosse has historically been played for the most part in [[Lacrosse in Canada|Canada]] and the [[Lacrosse in the United States|United States]], with small but dedicated lacrosse communities in the [[Lacrosse in England|United]] [[Lacrosse in Scotland|Kingdom]] and [[Lacrosse in Australia|Australia]].

===Federation of International Lacrosse===
{{main|Federation of International Lacrosse}}

In August 2008, the men's international governing body, the International Lacrosse Federation, merged with the women's, the International Federation of Women's Lacrosse Associations, to form the Federation of International Lacrosse (FIL). There are currently 62 members of the FIL.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://filacrosse.com/fil-members/ | title=FIL Members – Federation of International Lacrosse | date=January 2019}}</ref>

===Tournaments===
The FIL sponsors five world championship tournaments: the [[World Lacrosse Championship]] for men's field, the [[Women's Lacrosse World Cup]] for women's, the [[World Indoor Lacrosse Championship]] for box lacrosse, and the [[Under-19 World Lacrosse Championships]] for men and women. Each is held every four years.<ref>{{cite web|title=About FIL|url=https://filacrosse.com/fil/|publisher=Federation of International Lacrosse|accessdate=November 14, 2017}}</ref>

The World Lacrosse Championship (WLC) began in 1968 as a four-team invitational tournament sponsored by the International Lacrosse Federation. Until 1990, only the United States, Canada, England, and Australia had entered. With the expansion of the game internationally, the [[2014 World Lacrosse Championship]] was contested by 38 countries.<ref>{{cite press release |title=Record Field for 2014 FIL World Championship|url=http://worldlacrosse2014.com/news/020714_record_field_for_fil_world_championship|publisher=US Lacrosse|accessdate=November 14, 2017}}</ref> The WLC has been dominated by the United States.

An obstacle for lacrosse to return to the Olympics is insufficient international participation. To be considered for the Olympics, a sport must be played on four continents and by at least 75 countries. Lacrosse is played on all six continents, but the most recent world championships have involved 38 men's teams and 25 women's teams.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==Equipment==
[[File:Womens lacrosse stick head 2.jpg|thumb|Women's lacrosse stick]]

===Stick===
{{main|Lacrosse stick}}
The lacrosse stick has two parts, the head and the shaft.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

There are three parts to the head: the scoop, sidewall, and pocket. The scoop is the top of the stick that affects picking up ground ball as well as passing and shooting. The sidewall is the side of the head that affects the depth of the head and the stiffness. The pocket is the leather or nylon mesh attached to the sidewalll and scoop. A wider pocket allows an easier time catching balls, but will also cause less ball control. A narrower pocket makes catching harder, but allows more ball retention and accuracy.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Shafts are usually made of hollow metal. They are octagonal, instead of round, in order to provide a better grip. Most are made of [[aluminum]], [[titanium]], [[scandium]], or alloys, but some shafts are made from other materials, including wood, plastic, carbon fiber, or [[fiberglass]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

Stick length, both shaft and head together, is governed by NCAA regulations, which require that men's sticks be from 40 to 42&nbsp;inches long for offensive players, 52 to 72&nbsp;inches long for defensemen, and 40 to 72&nbsp;inches long for goalies.<ref name=equipment />

Women's sticks must be an overall length of 35.5 - 43.25 inches. The head must be seven to nine inches wide and the top of the ball must remain above the side walls when dropped in the pocket. The goalkeeper's stick must be 35.5 - 48 inches long. The head of the goalie's stick can up to 12 inches wide and the pocket may be mesh.<ref>{{cite web|title=Equipment for Girls' and Women's Lacrosse|url=https://www.uslacrosse.org/safety/equipment/player-equipment#women|publisher=US Lacrosse}}</ref>

===Men's field protective equipment===
Men's field lacrosse protective equipment contains a pair of [[lacrosse glove|gloves]], elbow pads, shoulder pads, [[lacrosse helmet|helmet]], and mouthguard. Pads differ in size and protection from player to player based on position, ability, comfort and preference. For example, many attack players wear larger and more protective elbow pads to protect themselves from checks thrown at them while defenders typically wear smaller and less protective pads due to their smaller possibility of being checked and goalies usually wear no elbow pads due to the very limited opportunities of being checked. A goalkeeper must also wear a large protective chest pad to cover their stomach and chest and a plastic neck guard that connects to the chin of their helmet to protect them from shots hitting their windpipe. In addition, male goalkeepers are required to wear a protective cup.<ref name=equipment />

===Men's box protective equipment===
Men's box players wear more protective gear than field players due to the increased physical contact and more permissive checking rules. Cross-checking in the back is allowed by the rules. Runners wear larger and heavier elbow pads and stronger shoulder pads that extend down the back of the player. Most players wear rib pads as well. Box goalies wear equipment very similar to ice hockey goalies, the leg blockers are somewhat smaller, although the shoulder pads are bigger than ice hockey pads.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

===Women's field protective equipment===
Women's field players are not required to wear protective equipment besides eyegear and a mouthguard. Eyegear is a metal cage covering the eyes attached with a strap around the back of the head. In recent years, there has been discussion about allowing or requiring padded headgear to protect against concussions. Women goalies wear a helmet, gloves, and chest protector.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}
