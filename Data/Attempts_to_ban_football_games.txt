There have been many attempts to ban [[football]], from the [[middle ages]] through to the modern day.

Women were banned from playing at English and Scottish Football League grounds in 1921, a ban that was only lifted in the 1970s. Female footballers still face similar problems in some parts of the world.

==Mass football in Europe==
Mass or [[mob football]] was popular in [[Middle Ages|medieval]] and [[early modern Europe]]. It involved an unlimited number of players and very few rules; the game often caused damage to people and property and was seen as a distraction from more desirable work which led to many attempts at banning the game in Britain and France.

===England===
Complaints by London merchants led King [[Edward II of England]] to issue a proclamation banning football in London on 13 April 1314 because, "...there is great noise in the city caused by hustling over large balls from which many evils may arise which God forbid; we command and forbid, on behalf of the King, on pain of imprisonment, such game to be used in the city in the future."<ref name="Orejan">{{cite book |title=Football/Soccer: History and Tactics |last=Orejan |first=Jaime |year=2011 |publisher=McFarland & Company |location=USA |isbn=978-0-7864-4784-8 |page=18}}<!--|accessdate=18 August 2013 --></ref>

This led [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] and [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]] of England to ban football in 1349 and 1477 respectively; the latter stated that, "No person shall practice...football and such games, but every strong and able bodied person shall practice with the bow for the reason that the national defence depends upon such bowmen." <ref name="Orejan" /> [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] also tried to outlaw the sport in 1389, as did  [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]] in 1401.

Despite ordering the first known pair of [[football boots]], [[Henry VIII of England]] attempted a ban in 1540.<ref>{{Cite web

"football" was used disapprovingly by [[William Shakespeare]]. Shakespeare's play ''[[King Lear]]'' contains the line: "Nor tripped neither, you base football player" (Act I, Scene 4).
Shakespeare also mentions the game in ''[[A Comedy of Errors]]'' (Act II, Scene 1):

{{quote|<poem>Am I so round with you as you with me,
That like a football you do spurn me thus?
You spurn me hence, and he will spurn me hither:

"Spurn" literally means ''to kick away'', thus implying that the game involved kicking a ball between players.

King [[James I of England]]'s ''Book of Sports'' (1618) however, instructs Christians to play at football every Sunday afternoon after worship.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sHrejZJVc80C&pg=RA3-PA412&dq=football |title=John Lord Campbell, '&#39;The Lives of the Lords Chancellors and Keepers of the Great Seal of England'&#39;, vol. 2, 1851, p. 412 |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-06-19|year=1851}}</ref> The book's aim appears to be an attempt to offset the strictness of the [[Puritans]] regarding the keeping of the [[Sabbath in Christianity|Sabbath]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reformed.org/books/hetherington/west_assembly/index.html?mainframe=/books/hetherington/west_assembly/chapter_1a.html#Book%20of%20Sports1618 |title=William Maxwell Hetherington, 1856, '&#39;History of the Westminster Assembly of Divines, Ch.1 (Third Ed.) |publisher=Reformed.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-16}}</ref>

The [[Puritan]]s had some success in suppressing "disorderly" sports including football after the [[English Civil War]]. Players were fined or sentenced to public humiliation in the [[stocks]]. The Mayor of [[York]] fined 11 players 20 [[Shilling (English coin)|shillings]] each when their game resulted in a smashed church window in the winter of 1659-60. The prosecution triggered a violent protest and resulted in over 100 armed men breaking into the Mayor's house; the ringleader was later fined 10 [[Pound sterling|pounds]] or 400 shillings, a very large sum of money at the time.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/newsandevents/pressreleases/ne1000000086166/ |accessdate=18 August 2013 |date=17 December 2003 |title=Historian Reveals that Cromwellian Christmas Football Rebels Ran Riot |publisher=[[University of Warwick]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1468/1468-h/1468-h.htm |last=Macaulay |first=Thomas Babington |authorlink=Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay |title=The History of England from the Accession of James the Second |volume=1 |year=1848 |quote=[In 1685] the wages of the common agricultural labourer, from March to September, were fixed at...four shillings a week without food.}}</ref> Football became even more popular following the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] in 1660.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

The French game [[La soule]] is another mass participation ball game similar to the English and Scottish mob football. It was banned by [[Philip V of France|Phillippe V]] in 1319, and again by [[Charles V of France|Charles V]] in 1369.

In 1440 the [[bishop of Tréguier]] threatened players with excommunication and a fine of 100 [[French sol|sol]], saying that "these dangerous and pernicious games must be prohibited because of hatred, grudges and enmities which, under the veil of recreational fun, accumulate in many hearts".<ref>{{cite journal |pages=576–7 |language=French |title=La soûle en Bretagne et les jeux similaires du Cornwall et du Pays de Galles |trans-title=La soule in Brittany and similar games in Cornwall and Wales |author=L.

==Enclosure Acts==
The [[Inclosure Acts|Enclosure Acts]] placed common land into individual ownership and removed the rights of local people to use the land as they had previously.

==Women's football==
English [[Women's football (soccer)|women's football]] matches began in 1895 but following the first international match in 1920, women were banned from all affiliated FA grounds from 1921-71 on the grounds that, "the game of football is quite unsuitable for females and ought not to be encouraged."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23147072 |title=Women's Euros 2013: Women's football's forgotten heroines |accessdate=17 August 2013 |last=Croydon |first=Emily |date=7 July 2013 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |location=UK}}</ref> The [[Scottish Football Association]] did not formally recognise women's football until 1973 after pressure from [[UEFA]].<ref name="Women Football and Europe" />{{rp|17}}

They played the first match before receiving a response: "Ladies should not play football... the ladies could also get injuries that destroyed their reproductive organs.

==Mass football in Europe==
Mass or [[mob football]] was popular in [[Middle Ages|medieval]] and [[early modern Europe]]. It involved an unlimited number of players and very few rules; the game often caused damage to people and property and was seen as a distraction from more desirable work which led to many attempts at banning the game in Britain and France.

===England===
Complaints by London merchants led King [[Edward II of England]] to issue a proclamation banning football in London on 13 April 1314 because, "...there is great noise in the city caused by hustling over large balls from which many evils may arise which God forbid; we command and forbid, on behalf of the King, on pain of imprisonment, such game to be used in the city in the future."<ref name="Orejan">{{cite book |title=Football/Soccer: History and Tactics |last=Orejan |first=Jaime |year=2011 |publisher=McFarland & Company |location=USA |isbn=978-0-7864-4784-8 |page=18}}<!--|accessdate=18 August 2013 --></ref>

Playing football was seen as a distraction from practising [[archery]], which was a mandatory occupation<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/21h.416/www/militarytechnology/longbow.html |accessdate=18 August 2013 |title=Engineering the Medieval Achievement - The Longbow |author= Prof. Anne McCants |website=web.mit.edu |publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]}}</ref> for every Englishman for much of the Middle Ages because archers were so valuable in battle at that time. This led [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] and [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]] of England to ban football in 1349 and 1477 respectively; the latter stated that, "No person shall practice...football and such games, but every strong and able bodied person shall practice with the bow for the reason that the national defence depends upon such bowmen." <ref name="Orejan" /> [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] also tried to outlaw the sport in 1389, as did  [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]] in 1401.

Despite ordering the first known pair of [[football boots]], [[Henry VIII of England]] attempted a ban in 1540.<ref>{{Cite web

By 1608, the local authorities in [[Manchester]] were complaining that: "With the ffotebale...[there] hath beene greate disorder in our towne of Manchester we are told, and glasse windowes broken yearlye and spoyled by a companie of lewd and disordered persons ..."<ref>[http://www.sport.gov.gr/2/24/243/2431/24314/243144/paper20.html International Olympic Academy (I.O.A.)

"football" was used disapprovingly by [[William Shakespeare]]. Shakespeare's play ''[[King Lear]]'' contains the line: "Nor tripped neither, you base football player" (Act I, Scene 4).
Shakespeare also mentions the game in ''[[A Comedy of Errors]]'' (Act II, Scene 1):

{{quote|<poem>Am I so round with you as you with me,
That like a football you do spurn me thus?
You spurn me hence, and he will spurn me hither:
If I last in this service, you must case me in leather.</poem>}}

"Spurn" literally means ''to kick away'', thus implying that the game involved kicking a ball between players.

King [[James I of England]]'s ''Book of Sports'' (1618) however, instructs Christians to play at football every Sunday afternoon after worship.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sHrejZJVc80C&pg=RA3-PA412&dq=football |title=John Lord Campbell, '&#39;The Lives of the Lords Chancellors and Keepers of the Great Seal of England'&#39;, vol. 2, 1851, p. 412 |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-06-19|year=1851}}</ref> The book's aim appears to be an attempt to offset the strictness of the [[Puritans]] regarding the keeping of the [[Sabbath in Christianity|Sabbath]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reformed.org/books/hetherington/west_assembly/index.html?mainframe=/books/hetherington/west_assembly/chapter_1a.html#Book%20of%20Sports1618 |title=William Maxwell Hetherington, 1856, '&#39;History of the Westminster Assembly of Divines, Ch.1 (Third Ed.) |publisher=Reformed.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-16}}</ref>

The [[Puritan]]s had some success in suppressing "disorderly" sports including football after the [[English Civil War]]. Players were fined or sentenced to public humiliation in the [[stocks]]. The Mayor of [[York]] fined 11 players 20 [[Shilling (English coin)|shillings]] each when their game resulted in a smashed church window in the winter of 1659-60. The prosecution triggered a violent protest and resulted in over 100 armed men breaking into the Mayor's house; the ringleader was later fined 10 [[Pound sterling|pounds]] or 400 shillings, a very large sum of money at the time.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/newsandevents/pressreleases/ne1000000086166/ |accessdate=18 August 2013 |date=17 December 2003 |title=Historian Reveals that Cromwellian Christmas Football Rebels Ran Riot |publisher=[[University of Warwick]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1468/1468-h/1468-h.htm |last=Macaulay |first=Thomas Babington |authorlink=Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay |title=The History of England from the Accession of James the Second |volume=1 |year=1848 |quote=[In 1685] the wages of the common agricultural labourer, from March to September, were fixed at...four shillings a week without food.}}</ref> Football became even more popular following the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] in 1660.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

The annual [[Scoring the Hales|Shrove Tuesday game]] was first played in 1762 in the streets of [[Alnwick]], and similar games were popular in many towns and villages at the time. The games were typically played in the streets which caused damage to property. A law was passed in 1818 banning street football. This law was ignored in Alnwick until 1827 when the [[Hugh Percy, 3rd Duke of Northumberland|Duke of Northumberland]] provided a field for the game to be played on legitimately.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.northumberlandgazette.co.uk/news/local-news/it-s-all-kicking-off-at-shrovetide-1-3136609 |title=It’s all kicking off at Shrovetide |date=4 March 2011 |publisher=[[Northumberland Gazette]] |accessdate=17 August 2013}}</ref>

[[James I of Scotland]] decreed that ''Na man play at the fut ball,'' in the [[Football Act 1424|Football Act of 1424]];<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/history/the-game/opposition-to-the-game.html |accessdate=17 August 2013 |title=History of Football - Opposition to the Game |publisher=FIFA}}</ref> a further act of parliament was passed under the rule of [[James II of Scotland|James II]] in 1457 which banned both football and golf.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://digital.nls.uk/golf-in-scotland/banned/1457-act.html |accessdate=17 August 2013 |title=Acts of Parliament banning golf |publisher=[[National Library of Scotland]] }}</ref>

===France===
The French game [[La soule]] is another mass participation ball game similar to the English and Scottish mob football. It was banned by [[Philip V of France|Phillippe V]] in 1319, and again by [[Charles V of France|Charles V]] in 1369.

In 1440 the [[bishop of Tréguier]] threatened players with excommunication and a fine of 100 [[French sol|sol]], saying that "these dangerous and pernicious games must be prohibited because of hatred, grudges and enmities which, under the veil of recreational fun, accumulate in many hearts".<ref>{{cite journal |pages=576–7 |language=French |title=La soûle en Bretagne et les jeux similaires du Cornwall et du Pays de Galles |trans-title=La soule in Brittany and similar games in Cornwall and Wales |author=L.

==Enclosure Acts==
The [[Inclosure Acts|Enclosure Acts]] placed common land into individual ownership and removed the rights of local people to use the land as they had previously. Football was used as a means to protest this enclosure, and the supposed football game was often a pretext to organise a riot.
