Even though Waboba is short for WAter BOuncing BAll, the name is specific to the brand and its products only.

==History==
All balls can bounce on water when thrown at a shallow angle with sufficient speed to hydroplane.

This was the principle employed by WW2-period British inventor Barnes Wallace when he developed the "bouncing bomb" used in the famous "[[Operation Chastise|Dam Busters]]" raid against the Ruhr District dams.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOGRTlrYCIE|title=bouncing bomb|date=5 April 2009|accessdate=9 November 2017|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> He had been inspired by the story of a technique historically used by the British navy that bounced spherical canon balls off the ocean surface to achieve accurate hits against enemy ships.

In Sweden in the early 1980s, inventor Jan Von Heland got the idea of commercialising something that skips on water after throwing a [[Frisbee]] upside down and noticing it skims the surface of water much like skipping a rock.

==The game==
[[Image:Waboba Play 25 - Small.jpg|thumb|right|Two people playing Waboba]]

===Official match game===
The object of the 4v4 game is to bounce the Waboba Pro on the water in order to pass to team members and score points by bouncing the ball into a goal.

Described as a cross between ultimate frisbee and water polo, the official match game is a team water sport played with the Pro ball that bounces on water. Teams consist of 3 field players, a goalkeeper and 2 substitutes. The winner of the game is the team that scores the most goals. The object of the game is to pass the ball with at least one bounce on water between team members in order to score goals. No direct passes allowed. There are no offside rules so teams have the ability to spread players across the game field, facilitating long, uninterrupted passes.<ref name="waboba.com">{{cite web |url=http://waboba.com/howtoplay |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808151733/http://waboba.com/howtoplay/ |archivedate=2014-08-08 |df= }} </ref>

===Ultimate Waboba===
Use any Waboba ball. Each team, a minimum of 2 players per team, passes the Waboba to each other to complete a round. A team gets 1 point when each team member has caught the ball without interruption from the opposing team. A pass must bounce on the water before being caught. First team to 3 points wins. Passes have to be made within 5 seconds after receiving the ball. No holding players allowed.<ref name="waboba.com"/>

==Physics==
An elastic ball that bounces on water, the Waboba water balls flatten like a pancake when they hits the water surface, increasing its lift and propelling it upward. When it hits the water at a shallow angle, it too creates a bowl-shaped depression. But because it is soft, the ball flattens into a disc-shape when it hits the surface and this allows it to aquaplane efficiently across the surface. And the angle of the bowl-shaped depression causes it to launch into the air where the ball regains its shape, making it look as if it has bounced. The process is remarkably similar to the way stones skip across water, even though they are denser than the liquid. A shallow impact with the water surface creates a bowl-shaped depression that launches the stone into the air as it leaves.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/view/425827/like-stones-why-some-balls-bounce-on-water/|title=Like Stones, Why Some Balls Bounce On Water|website=Technologyreview.com|accessdate=9 November 2017}}</ref>

==Naval use==
Researchers with the U.S. Navy's University Laboratory Initiative have been studying the mechanics and elasticity of the Waboba balls. The military branch is interested in how elasticity affects motion in water.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/43917-toy-physics-waboba-ball.html|title=US Navy Toys With Physics of Bouncy Balls|website=Livescience.com|accessdate=9 November 2017}}</ref>

==The game==

===Official match game===
The object of the 4v4 game is to bounce the Waboba Pro on the water in order to pass to team members and score points by bouncing the ball into a goal.

Described as a cross between ultimate frisbee and water polo, the official match game is a team water sport played with the Pro ball that bounces on water. Teams consist of 3 field players, a goalkeeper and 2 substitutes. The winner of the game is the team that scores the most goals. The object of the game is to pass the ball with at least one bounce on water between team members in order to score goals. No direct passes allowed. There are no offside rules so teams have the ability to spread players across the game field, facilitating long, uninterrupted passes.<ref name="waboba.com">{{cite web |url=http://waboba.com/howtoplay |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808151733/http://waboba.com/howtoplay/ |archivedate=2014-08-08 |df= }} </ref>

===Ultimate Waboba===
Use any Waboba ball. Each team, a minimum of 2 players per team, passes the Waboba to each other to complete a round. A team gets 1 point when each team member has caught the ball without interruption from the opposing team. A pass must bounce on the water before being caught. First team to 3 points wins. Passes have to be made within 5 seconds after receiving the ball. No holding players allowed.<ref name="waboba.com"/>

==Physics==
An elastic ball that bounces on water, the Waboba water balls flatten like a pancake when they hits the water surface, increasing its lift and propelling it upward. When it hits the water at a shallow angle, it too creates a bowl-shaped depression. But because it is soft, the ball flattens into a disc-shape when it hits the surface and this allows it to aquaplane efficiently across the surface. And the angle of the bowl-shaped depression causes it to launch into the air where the ball regains its shape, making it look as if it has bounced. The process is remarkably similar to the way stones skip across water, even though they are denser than the liquid. A shallow impact with the water surface creates a bowl-shaped depression that launches the stone into the air as it leaves.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/view/425827/like-stones-why-some-balls-bounce-on-water/|title=Like Stones, Why Some Balls Bounce On Water|website=Technologyreview.com|accessdate=9 November 2017}}</ref>

==Naval use==
Researchers with the U.S. Navy's University Laboratory Initiative have been studying the mechanics and elasticity of the Waboba balls. The military branch is interested in how elasticity affects motion in water.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/43917-toy-physics-waboba-ball.html|title=US Navy Toys With Physics of Bouncy Balls|website=Livescience.com|accessdate=9 November 2017}}</ref>
