'''''{{lang|is|Knattleikr}}''''' (English: 'ball-game') was an ancient ball game played by the [[Vikings]] of [[Iceland]]. The term is also applied to a modern sport created by re-enactors, and now played at a few United States institutions as a [[college club sport]], based on what is known about the historical game.

==How the game was played==
The game was probably similar to early versions of the Irish sport of [[hurling]], which also dates to antiquity.  Today, no one knows exact rules of ''Knattleikr'', but some information has survived from the [[Viking Age]] in Iceland (beginning around the 9th century).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broomball.com.au/ancienthistory.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060524143958/http://www.broomball.com.au/ancienthistory.shtml |archivedate=2006-05-24 |df= }}{{better source needed|date=July 2016}}</ref>

We know that players were divided into teams, each with a captain. The game demanded so much time that it was played from morning to night. It was a spectator game, with tournaments drawing huge crowds from all over Iceland. 

Game-play involved a hard ball was hit by a stick, although players could also use their hands. Body contact was allowed in the fight for the ball where the strongest had the best chance to win. Thus, intimidation was a vital ingredient; several wars of words have been recorded in the old sagas. There were penalties and a penalty box.

It is conjectured by some{{weasel inline|date=July 2016}} that the playing field was lined, usually played on a flat ice?covered surface, e.g. a frozen pond (though bumpy, land?based ice, {{lang|isl|svell}}, is also mentioned). The Vikings may have used tar and sand under the soles of their boots for traction.
