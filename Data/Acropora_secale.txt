'''''Acropora secale''''' is a [[species]] of branching staghorn  [[Scleractinia|stony]] [[coral]]. It is found in shallow parts of the Indo-Pacific Ocean and the [[type locality (biology)|type locality]] is Sri Lanka. The oldest fossils found date back to the [[Pleistocene]].<ref name=Wallace>{{cite book |title=Staghorn Corals of the World: A Revision of the Genus Acropora |last=Wallace |first=Carden |year=1999 |publisher=Csiro Publishing |isbn=0643102817 |url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=MSUKr0vP3lQC&oi=fnd&pg=PP23&dq=Acropora+secale&ots=afu5z3Vjny&sig=aHgm_ImhkbvxDwnDSvXMDE8ZKCo }}</ref>

==Description==
''Acropora secale'' is a [[Colony (biology)|colonial]] coral that forms low hummocks. The branches can grow to a diameter of {{convert|20|mm|1|abbr=on}} and length of {{convert|70|mm}}. They are cylindrical but gradually taper towards the tips. They grow in a [[corymb]]ose fashion with the lower branches being longer than the upper ones so that the coral has a level-topped appearance. The [[corallite]]s are of varying sizes and arranged in vertical rows, often with alternate rows of larger and smaller corallites.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://coral.aims.gov.au/speciesPages/species_metadata/0062/view |title=''Acropora secale'' |date=2011-06-24 |work=Corals of the World |publisher=Australian Institute of Marine Science |accessdate=2013-01-05}}</ref> The axial corallites are up to {{convert|3|mm}} in diameter while the radial corallites either have long tubular openings or nariform (noselike) openings. The skeleton is covered by a thin [[ectoderm]]al layer of tissue. When feeding, the polyps protrude from the corallites. Each has a single ring of twelve tentacles, one of which is longer than the others. The polyps have a mouth which opens into the coelenteron. This interconnects with other polyps through a complex system of channels, the [[coenenchyme]], inside the porous skeleton.<ref name=Wallace/> Several colour schemes occur in this coral, purple with yellow tips to the branches, pale brown with blue tips, plain green or plain brown.<ref name=Wallace/>

==Distribution==
''Acropora secale'' is found in the tropical waters of the west Indo-Pacific including the coasts of East Africa, Mozambique, [[Rodrigues]], [[Aldabra]] and [[Chagos]].<ref name=WoRMS/> It is also found further east around Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, Japan, the Philippines, Taiwan and north and west Australia. It is a reef-building coral and occurs at depths down to {{convert|5|m}} on outer reef flats, reef slopes, reef edges and walls.<ref name=Wallace/>

==Biology==
''Acropora secale'' is a [[zooxanthellate]] species of coral.<ref name=WoRMS/> This means that it has [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]] [[dinoflagellate]]s living within its tissues.  These, combined with pigments in the tissue, are responsible for the colour of the colony.<ref name=Wallace/>

''Acropora secale'' is a [[hermaphrodite]] and both female gonads and testes are present and mature once a year. The colonies release [[Egg (biology)|eggs]] and sperm simultaneously, usually six days after the full moon, in November in the Southern Hemisphere and in June in the Northern Hemisphere.<ref name=Wallace/> Fertilisation is external; the developing larvae form part of the [[plankton]] and drift with the current before settling on the seabed.<ref name=Wallace/>
