The '''Mozambique tilapia''' (''Oreochromis mossambicus'') is a [[tilapiine]] [[cichlid]] fish native to southern Africa. It is a popular fish for [[aquaculture]].  Dull colored, the Mozambique tilapia often lives up to a decade in its native habitats.  Due to human [[Introduced species|introductions]], it is now found in many tropical and subtropical habitats around the globe, where it can become an [[invasive species]] because of its robust nature. These same features make it a good species for aquaculture because it readily adapts to new situations.  It is known as '''black tilapia''' in [[Colombia]]<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.parquesnacionales.gov.co/portal/especies-exoticas-con-potencial-invasor/listado-oficial-de-especies-invasoras-para-colombia/ | title=Listado oficial de especies invasoras para Colombia &#124; Parques Nacionales Naturales de Colombia}}</ref> and as '''blue kurper''' in [[South Africa]].<ref>[http://www.bigbass.0catch.com/id8a.htm Big Bass]</ref>

==Description==

The native Mozambique tilapia is laterally compressed, and has a deep body with long dorsal fins, the front part of which have spines. Native coloration is a dull greenish or yellowish, and weak banding may be seen. Adults reach approximately {{convert|35|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length and up to {{convert|1.13|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. Size and coloration may vary in captive and naturalized populations due to environmental and breeding pressures. It lives  up to 11 years.

It is a remarkably robust and fecund fish, readily adapting to available food sources and breeding under suboptimal conditions. It also tolerates brackish water and survives temperatures below {{convert|50|F|C}} and above {{convert|100|F|C}}, but sustained water temperatures of 55&nbsp;°F are lethal to Mozambique tilapia.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

==Distribution==
[[File:Mozambique tilapia preserved for lab purposes.jpg|thumbnail|left|preserved for lab purposes.]]
The Mozambique tilapia is native to coastal regions and the lower reaches of rivers in southern Africa, from the [[Zambezi River]] delta to [[Bushman River]] in the eastern Cape.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.issg.org/database/species/ecology.asp?si=131 | title=GISD}}</ref>  It is threatened in its home range by competition with the invasive [[Nile tilapia]].<ref>Waal 2002</ref>

==Diet==
Mozambique tilapia are omnivorous.  They can consume detrital material, diatoms, invertebrates, small fry and vegetation ranging from macroalgae to rooted plants.<ref>Mook 1983</ref><ref>Trewevas 1983</ref> This broad diet helps the species thrive in diverse locations.

==Invasiveness==
The Mozambique tilapia is an [[invasive species]] in many parts of the world, having escaped from aquaculture or been deliberately introduced to control mosquitoes.<ref>Moyle 1976</ref>  It has been nominated by the Invasive Species Specialist Group  as one of the 100 worst invasive species in the world.<ref>Courtenay 1989</ref>  It can harm native fish populations through competition for food and nesting space, as well as by directly consuming small fish.<ref>Courtenay et al. 1974</ref>  In Hawaii, striped mullet ''[[Mugil cephalus]]'' are threatened because of the introduction of this species. Mozambique tilapia may also be responsible for the decline of the desert pupfish, ''[[Cyprinodon macularius]]'', in California's [[Salton Sea]].<ref>Courtenay and Robins 1989</ref><ref>Swift et al. 1993</ref>

==Hybridization==
As with most species of tilapia, Mozambique tilapia have a high potential for [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]].  They are often crossbred with other tilapia species in aquaculture because purebred Mozambique tilapia grow slowly and have a body shape poorly suited to cutting large [[fillet (cut)|fillet]]s.  Also, hybrids between certain parent combinations (such as between Mozambique and [[Wami tilapia]]) result in offspring that are all or predominantly male. Male tilapia are preferred in aquaculture as they grow faster and have a more uniform adult size than females. The "Florida Red" tilapia is a popular commercial hybrid of Mozambique and [[blue tilapia]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/FA012 | title=Culture of Hybrid Tilapia: A Reference Profile| date=2018-11-21}}</ref>

==Feeding behavior and environment==
Although Mozambique tilapias generally live in [[rivers]] and [[lagoons]], they can also colonize fast-flowing areas of water such as creeks and [[streams]].  Due to their robust nature, Mozambique tilapias often over-colonize the habitat around them, eventually becoming the most abundant species in a particular area.  When over-crowding happens and resources get scarce, adults will sometimes [[cannibalize]] the young for more nutrients.  Mozambique tilapia, like other fish such as [[Nile tilapia]] and [[trout]], are opportunistic [[omnivores]] and will feed on [[algae]], plant matter, organic particles, small invertebrates and other fish.<ref name=Factsheet>{{cite web|title=Biology and ecology of Mozambique tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus)|url=http://www.feral.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/TILFS3_web.pdf|publisher=feral.org.au|accessdate=24 October 2013}}</ref>   Feeding patterns vary depending on which food source is the most abundant and the most accessible at the time.  In captivity, Mozambique tilapias have been known to learn how to feed themselves using demand feeders.  During commercial feeding, the fish may energetically jump out of the water for food.<ref name="Online Guide">{{cite web|last=De Peaza|first=Mia|title=Oreochromis mossambicus (Mozambique Tilapia)|url=http://sta.uwi.edu/fst/lifesciences/documents/Oreochromis_mossambicus.pdf|publisher=UWI|accessdate=24 October 2013}}</ref>

==Social structure==
Mozambique tilapias often travel in groups where a strict [[dominance hierarchy]] is maintained.  Positions within the hierarchy correlate with territoriality, courtship rate, nest size, aggression, and hormone production.<ref name="Social Modulation">{{cite journal|last=Oliveira|first=Rui F.|author2=Vitor C. Almada |author3=Adelino V. M. Canario |title=Social Modulation of Sex Steroid Concentrations in the Urine of Male Cichlid Fish Oreochromis mossambicus|journal=Hormones and Behavior|year=1996|volume=30|issue=1|pages=2–12|doi=10.1006/hbeh.1996.0002|pmid=8724173|hdl=10400.1/3206}}</ref>  In terms of social structure, Mozambique tilapias engage in a system known as [[lek mating|lek-breeding]], where males establish territories with dominance hierarchies while females travel between them.  Social hierarchies typically develop because of competition for limited resources including food, territories, or mates.  During the breeding season, males cluster around certain territory, forming a dense aggregation in shallow water.<ref name=Outcome>{{cite journal|last=Amorim|first=M. Clara P.|author2=Almada, Vitor C.|title=The outcome of male–male encounters affects subsequent sound production during courtship in the cichlid fish Oreochromis mossambicus|journal=Animal Behaviour|date=1 March 2005|volume=69|issue=3|pages=595–601|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2004.06.016|hdl=10400.12/1440}}</ref>  This aggregation forms the basis of the [[lek mating|lek]] through which the females preferentially choose their mates.  Reproductive success by males within the lek is highly correlated to social status and dominance.<ref name=Sterol>{{cite journal|last=Barata|first=Eduardo N.|author2=Fine, Jared M. |author3=Hubbard, Peter C. |author4=Almeida, Olinda G. |author5=Frade, Pedro |author6=Sorensen, Peter W. |author7= Canário, Adelino V.

In experiments with captive tilapias, evidence demonstrates the formation of linear hierarchies where the alpha male participates in significantly more agonistic interactions.  Thus, males that are higher ranked initiate much more aggressive acts than subordinate males.  However, contrary to popular belief, Mozambique tilapias display more [[agonistic behaviour|agonistic interactions]] towards fish that are farther apart in the hierarchy scale than they do towards individuals closer in rank.  One hypothesis behind this action rests with the fact that aggressive actions are costly.  In this context, members of this social system tend to avoid confrontations with neighboring ranks in order to conserve resources rather than engage in an unclear and risky fight.  Instead, dominant individuals seek to bully subordinate tilapias both for an easy fight and to keep their rank.<ref name=Dominance>{{cite journal|last=Oliveira|first=R.F.|author2=V.C. Almada|title=Dominance hierarchies and social structure in captive groups of the Mozambique tilapia Oreochromis mossambicus (Teleostei Cichlidae)|journal=Ethology Ecology & Evolution|year=1996|volume=8|pages=39–55|doi=10.1080/08927014.1996.9522934|hdl=10400.12/1330}}</ref>

==Communication and aggression==
Urine in Mozambique tilapias, like many freshwater fish species, acts as a vector for communication amongst individuals.  Hormones and [[pheromones]] released with urine by the fish often affect the behavior and physiology of the opposite sex.  Dominant males signal females through the use of a urinary odorant.  Further studies have suggested that females respond to the ratio of chemicals within the urine, as opposed to the odor itself.  Nevertheless, females are known to be able to distinguish between hierarchical rank and dominant vs. subordinate males through chemicals in urine.

Urinary pheromones also play a part in male – male interaction for Mozambique tilapias.  Studies have shown that male aggression is highly correlated with increased urination.  Symmetrical aggression between males resulted in an increase in the release of urination frequency.  Dominant males both store and release more potent urine during [[agonistic behaviour|agonistic interactions]].  Thus, both the initial stage of lek formation and the maintenance of social hierarchy may highly depend on the males’ varying urinary output.<ref name="Male urine">{{cite journal|last=Barata|first=Eduardo N|author2=Hubbard, Peter C |author3=Almeida, Olinda G |author4=Miranda, António |author5= Canário, Adelino VM |title=Male urine signals social rank in the Mozambique tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus)|journal=BMC Biology|date=1 January 2007|volume=5|issue=1|pages=54|doi=10.1186/1741-7007-5-54|pmid=18076759|pmc=2222621}}</ref>

Aggression amongst males usually involve a typical sequence of visual, acoustic, and tactile signals that eventually escalates to physical confrontation if no resolution is reached.  Usually, conflict ends before physical aggression as fights are both costly and risky.  Bodily damage may impede an individual’s ability to find a mate in the future.  In order to prevent cheating, in which individual may fake his own fitness, these aggressive rituals incur significant energetic costs.  Thus, cheating is prevented by the sheer fact that the costs of initiating a ritual often outweigh the benefits of cheating.  In this regard, differences between individuals in endurance plays a critical role in resolving the winner and the loser.<ref name=Aggressive>{{cite journal|last=Ros|first=Albert F.H.|author2=Klaus Becker |author3=Rui F. Oliveira |title=Aggressive behaviour and energy metabolism in a cichlid fish, Oreochromis mossambicus|journal=Physiology & Behavior|date=30 May 2006|pages=164–70|doi=10.1016/j.physbeh.2006.05.043 |pmid=16828128|volume=89|issue=2|hdl=10400.12/1299}}</ref>

==Reproduction==
In the first step in the reproductive cycle for Mozambique tilapia, males excavate a nest into which a female can lay her eggs. After the eggs are laid, the male [[external fertilization|fertilizes]] them. Then the female stores the eggs in her mouth until the fry hatch; this act is called [[mouthbrooding]].<ref name="Popma, 1999">Popma, 1999</ref>  One of the main reasons behind the aggressive actions of Mozambique tilapias is access to reproductive mates.  The designation of Mozambique tilapias as an invasive species rests on their life-history traits:  Tilapias exhibit high levels of parental care as well as the capacity to spawn multiple [[offspring|broods]] through an extended reproductive season, both contributing to their success in varying environments.<ref name=Reproductive>{{cite journal|last=Russell|first=D. J.|author2=Thuesen, P. A. |author3=Thomson, F. E. |title=Reproductive strategies of two invasive tilapia species Oreochromis mossambicus and Tilapia mariae in northern Australia|journal=Journal of Fish Biology|date=1 May 2012|volume=80|issue=6|pages=2176–2197|doi=10.1111/j.1095-8649.2012.03267.x|pmid=22551176}}</ref>  In the [[Lek mating|lek system]], males congregate and display themselves to attract females for matings.  Thus, mating success is highly skewed towards dominant males, who tend to be larger, more aggressive, and more effective at defending territories.  Dominant males also build larger nests for the [[spawn (biology)|spawn]].<ref name="Outcome"/>  During courtship rituals, acoustic communication is widely used by the males to attract females.  Studies have shown that females are attracted to dominant males who produce lower peak frequencies as well as higher pulse rates.  At the end of mating, males guard the nest while females take both the eggs and the sperm into their mouth.  Due to this, Mozambique tilapias can occupy many niches during spawning since the young can be transported in the mouth.<ref name=Sound>{{cite journal|last=Amorim|first=M. C. P.|author2=Fonseca, P. J. |author3=Almada, V. C. |title=Sound production during courtship and spawning of Oreochromis mossambicus: male-female and male-male interactions|journal=Journal of Fish Biology|date=1 March 2003|volume=62|issue=3|pages=658–672|doi=10.1046/j.1095-8649.2003.00054.x|hdl=10400.12/1452}}</ref>   These proficient reproductive strategies may be the cause behind their invasive tendencies.

Male Mozambique tilapias synchronize breeding behavior in terms of [[Courtship display|courtship]] activity and territoriality in order to take advantage of female spawning synchrony.  One of the costs associated with this synchronization is the increase in competition among males, which are already high on the [[dominance hierarchy]].  As a result, different mating tactics have evolved in these species.  Males may [[mimic]] females and sneak reproduction attempts when the dominant male is occupied.  Likewise, another strategy for males is to exist as a floater, travelling between territories in an attempt to find a mate.  Nevertheless, it is the dominant males who have the greatest reproductive advantage.<ref name="Mating tactics">{{cite journal|last=Oliveira|first=R. F.|author2=Almada, V. C.|title=Mating tactics and male-male courtship in the lek-breeding cichlid Oreochromis mossambicus|journal=Journal of Fish Biology|date=1 June 1998|volume=52|issue=6|pages=1115–1129|doi=10.1111/j.1095-8649.1998.tb00959.x|hdl=10400.12/1340}}</ref>

==Parental care==

Typically, Mozambique tilapias, like all species belonging to the genus ''[[Oreochromis]]'' and species like ''[[Astatotilapia burtoni]]'', are maternal mouthbrooders, meaning that spawn is incubated and raised in the mouth of the mother.  [[Parental care]] is, therefore, almost exclusive to the female.  Males do contribute by providing nests for the spawn before incubation, but the energy costs associated with nest production is low relative to mouthbrooding.  Compared to nonmouthbrooders,  both mouthbrooding and growing a new clutch of eggs is not energetically feasible.  Thus, Mozambique tilapias arrest [[oocyte]] growth during [[mouthbrooder|mouthbrooding]] to conserve energy.<ref name=Steroid>{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Carol Johnson|author2=Haley, Samuel R.|title=Steroid profiles of the female tilapia, Oreochromis mossambicus, and correlation with oocyte growth and mouthbrooding behavior|journal=General and Comparative Endocrinology|date=1 January 1988|volume=69|issue=1|pages=88–98|doi=10.1016/0016-6480(88)90056-1|pmid=3360291}}</ref>   Even with oocyte arrest, females that mouthbrood take significant costs in body weight, energy, and low fitness.  Hence, parental-offspring conflict is visible through the costs and benefits to the parents and the young.  A mother caring for her offspring carries the cost of reducing her own individual fitness.  Unlike most fish, Mozambique tilapias exhibit an extended maternal care period believed to allow social bonds to be formed.<ref name=Preferential>{{cite journal|last=Russock|first=Howard I.|title=Preferential Behaviour of Sarotherodon (Oreochromis) mossambicus (Pisces: Cichlidae) Fry to Maternal Models and Its Relevance to the Concept of Imprinting|journal=Behaviour|date=March 1986|volume=96|issue=3/4|pages=304–321|doi=10.1163/156853986x00531}}</ref>

==Use in aquaculture==
[[File:Tilapia mossambica Pune.JPG|thumb|right|250px|A Mozambique tilapia caught in a man-made lake, where it naturally occurs along with species introduced for aquaculture in [[Pune]], India]]
Mozambique tilapia are hardy individuals that are easy to raise and harvest, making them a good aquacultural species. They have a mild, white flesh that is appealing to consumers. This species constitutes about 4% of the total tilapia aquaculture production worldwide, but is more commonly hybridized with other tilapia species.<ref>Gupta and Acosta 2004</ref> Tilapia are very susceptible to diseases such as [[whirling disease]] and [[Ichthyophthirius multifiliis|ich]].<ref name="Popma, 1999"/> Mozambique tilapia are resistant to wide varieties of water quality issues and pollution levels. Because of these abilities they have been used as bioassay organisms to generate metal toxicity data for risk assessments of local freshwater species in [[South Africa]] rivers.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mashifane|first1=TB|last2=Moyo|first2=NAG|title=Acute toxicity of selected heavy metals to ''Oreochromis mossambicus'' fry and fingerlings|journal=African Journal of Aquatic Science|date=29 October 2014|volume=39|issue=3|pages=279–285|doi=10.2989/16085914.2014.960358}}</ref>
