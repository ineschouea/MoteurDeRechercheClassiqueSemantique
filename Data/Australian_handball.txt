__NOTOC__
'''Australian handball''' is a sport in which players hit a ball against one or more walls.

==Play==
Australian handball is similar to [[squash (sport)|squash]] played without a racquet. The ball is served such that it makes direct contact with the front wall without having bounced on the ground. It must then be returned similarly by the opponent to the front wall before the ball bounces on the ground twice.  It may also contact side walls to or from the front wall, but once a player has struck the ball with hand, it must make contact with the front before touching the ground.

The game is played in singles or doubles format. There are 1, 3 or 4 wall versions of this game. The typical Australian version is the three wall version, as most courts in Australia are set for this version. Perhaps the bulk of these playing venues are set in various private Catholic Colleges.<ref name=worldbookaustralia/><ref name=eddie/>
