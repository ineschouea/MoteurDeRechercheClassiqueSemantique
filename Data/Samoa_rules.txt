'''Samoa rules''' is a game derived from [[Australian rules football]] and [[rugby union]] that is occasionally played in [[Samoa]].

==Rules==
Generally the rules are taken from Australian rules, but each team consists of 15 players, like rugby union.<ref name=Clarke>http://www.travelblog.org/Oceania/Samoa/blog-84067.html retrieved 4 July 2009</ref>

Unlike Australian rules football, player movement is restricted to zones (similarly to [[rec footy]]).  There is a line across the centre that backs and forwards can not cross. [[Australian rules football positions#Followers|Onballers]] are allowed to go anywhere. Forwards can only operate in their attacking half, the backs in their defensive half.<ref name=Clarke/> Like [[Gaelic football]], players are permitted to bounce the ball only once while running, in order to encourage kicking.<ref name=Clarke/>

==Pitch==
The game is played on rugby union fields, sometimes a single one, or two side by side.<ref name=Clarke/> This means the pitch is rectangular, rather than oval, like an Australian football field.

==History==
The Vailima Six-Shooters' Championship began in Samoa in 1998 under these rules, becoming known as Samoa rules.  A number of Samoa rules players went on to represent Samoa in the [[Samoan national Australian rules football team]].
