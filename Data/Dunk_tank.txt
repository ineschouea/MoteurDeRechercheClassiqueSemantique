A '''dunk tank''', also known as a '''dunking booth''' or '''dunking machine''', is an attraction mainly used in [[fair]]s, [[fundraising|fundraisers]], and [[party|parties]]. It consists of a large tank of water, over which a volunteer sits on a collapsing seat.  When a ball strikes a target, the seat collapses, "dunking" the person into the water.<ref>{{cite book |first = April R. |last = Jervis |title = 365 Ways to Raise Funds for Your Nonprofit |year =  2011 |page = 37 }}</ref> People will often volunteer to get dunked fully clothed for a humorous effect.

==Safety==
Aside from cost, safety is the primary reason that a dunk tank might not be permitted at a given event. If the operator(s) is/are not fully trained or not giving the proper instructions, people have been injured on occasion. General safety guidelines include keeping hands off any part of the tank assembly—some rental companies recommend that the volunteer keeps their hands on their lap when sitting on a dunk tank. Grasping the seat could result in pinched fingers when the seat falls, and holding on to the side of the tank or enclosure could cause arm and shoulder injuries when falling in. There is also a slight risk of slipping on the bottom of the tank, so some rental companies recommend wearing shoes or sandals.

In 2016, Canadian TV personality Leslie Horton filed a $150,000 lawsuit after she struck her head on an unpadded part of a dunk tank.<ref>{{cite news |url = https://calgaryherald.com/news/crime/global-calgary-tv-personality-files-150k-lawsuit-over-dunk-tank-incident |title = Global Calgary TV Personality Files $150K Lawsuit Over Dunk Tank Injury |first = Kevin |last = Martin |date = July 8, 2016 |newspaper = [[Calgary Herald]] }}</ref>
