The '''jaguar''' (''Panthera onca'') is a [[felidae|wild cat]] [[species]] and the only [[extant taxon|extant]] member of the [[genus]] ''[[Panthera]]'' native to the [[Americas]]. The jaguar's present range extends from [[Southwestern United States]] and [[Mexico]] in [[North America]], across much of [[Central America]], and south to [[Paraguay]] and northern [[Argentina]] in [[South America]]. Though there are single cats now living within the Western United States, the species has largely been [[Local extinction|extirpated]] from the [[United States]] since the early [[20th century]]. It is listed as [[Near Threatened]] on the [[IUCN Red List]]; and its numbers are declining. Threats include loss and [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmentation of habitat]].

Overall, the jaguar is the largest native cat species of the New World and the [[List of largest cats|third largest in the world]]. This spotted cat closely resembles the [[leopard]], but is usually larger and sturdier. It ranges across a variety of forested and open terrains, but its preferred [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] is [[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forest]], [[swamp]]s and wooded regions. The jaguar enjoys swimming and is largely a [[Solitude|solitary]], opportunistic, stalk-and-ambush [[predator]] at [[apex predator|the top of the food chain]]. As a [[keystone species]] it plays an important role in stabilizing [[ecosystem]]s and regulating prey populations.

While international trade in jaguars or their body parts is prohibited, the cat is still frequently killed, particularly in conflicts with ranchers and farmers in South America. Although reduced, its range remains large. Given its historical distribution, the jaguar has featured prominently in the mythology of numerous [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous American cultures]], including those of the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] and [[Aztec]].

==Etymology==
The word 'jaguar' is thought to derive from the [[Tupian languages|Tupian]] word ''yaguara'', meaning "beast of prey".<ref name=etymology>{{cite web |author=Harper, D. |year=2001–2017 |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=jaguar |title=Jaguar | work = [[Online Etymology Dictionary]]|publisher=Douglas Harper}}</ref> The word entered English presumably via the Amazonian [[Pidgin|trade language]] [[Nheengatu language|Tupinambá]], via [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''jaguar''.<ref name=r1/><ref name=r2/> The specific word for jaguar is ''yaguareté'', with the suffix -''eté'' meaning "real" or "true".<ref name=r3/>

The word 'panther' derives from [[classical Latin]] ''panth?ra'', itself from the [[ancient Greek]] ''pánth?r'' (??????).<ref>{{cite web |author1=Liddell, H. G. |author2=R. Scott |lastauthoramp=yes |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2377441 |title=?????? |work=A Greek-English Lexicon, revised and augmented |year=1940 |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press}}</ref>

In [[Mexican Spanish]], its nickname is ''el tigre'': 16th century Spaniards had no native word in their language for the jaguar, which is smaller than a lion, but bigger than a leopard, nor had ever encountered it in the Old World, and so named it after the [[tiger]], since its ferocity would have been known to them through Roman writings and popular literature during the Renaissance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mexicolore.co.uk/aztecs/flora-and-fauna/jaguar|title=The Jaguar in Mexico|publisher=''Mexicolore''}}</ref>

''Onca'' is the Portuguese [[wikt:onça|''onça'']], with the [[cedilla]] dropped for typographical reasons, found in English as ''ounce'' for the [[snow leopard]], ''Panthera uncia''. It derives from the Latin ''lyncea'' [[lynx]], with the letter L confused with the [[Article (grammar)#Definite article|definite article]] (Italian ''lonza'', [[Old French]] ''l'once)''.<ref name=r6/>

==Taxonomy==
In 1758, [[Carl Linnaeus]] described the jaguar in his work ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' and gave it the [[scientific name]] ''Felis onca''.<ref name="Linn1758">{{cite book |author=Linnaeus, C. |year=1758 |title=Caroli Linnæi Systema naturæ per regna tria naturæ, secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis |volume=Tomus I |edition=decima, reformata |location=Holmiae |publisher=Laurentius Salvius |page=42 |chapter=''Felis onca'' |chapterurl=https://archive.org/stream/mobot31753000798865#page/41/mode/2up}} {{la icon}}</ref>

The spots and their shapes vary between individual jaguars: rosettes may include one or several dots. The spots on the head and neck are generally solid, as are those on the tail, where they may merge to form a band.<ref name=Seymour/> Forest jaguars are frequently darker and considerably smaller than those in open areas, possibly due to the smaller numbers of large, herbivorous prey in forest areas.<ref name=CAP/>

Its size and weight vary considerably: weights are normally in the range of {{convert|56|-|96|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. Exceptionally big males have been recorded to weigh as much as {{convert|158|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.<ref name=r10/><ref name="Animal"/> The smallest females weigh about {{convert|36|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.<ref name=r10/> Females are typically 10–20 percent [[Sexually dimorphic|smaller than males]].

===Colour variation===
[[File:Black Jaguar (Panthera onca).JPG|thumb||A melanistic jaguar is a color morph which occurs at about 6 percent frequency in populations]]
Melanistic jaguars are informally known as [[black panther]]s, but as with all forms of [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]] they do not form a separate species. The [[melanism|black morph]] is less common than the spotted morph, estimated at occurring in about 6% of the South American jaguar population.<ref>{{cite book |authors=Brown, D.E. and Lopez-Gonzalez, C.A. |date=2001 |title=Borderland jaguars: tigres de la frontera |publisher=University of Utah Press |location=Salt Lake City, UT}}</ref> In Mexico's [[Sierra Madre Occidental]], the first black jaguar was recorded in 2004.<ref name=Dinets>{{cite journal |last=Dinets |first=V. |last2=Polechla |first2=P.

Some evidence indicates that the melanistic [[allele]] is dominant, and being supported by [[natural selection]].<ref name=Meyer/> The black form may be an example of [[heterozygote advantage]]; breeding in captivity is not yet conclusive on this. Melanistic jaguars (or "black" jaguars) occur primarily in parts of South America, and are virtually unknown in wild populations residing in the subtropical and temperate regions of North America; they have rarely been documented north of Mexico's [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]].<ref>U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2016, Jaguar Draft Recovery Plan, p.5</ref>

Extremely rare [[albino]] individuals, sometimes called [[white panther]]s, also occur among jaguars, as with the other big cats.<ref name=CAP/> As usual with albinos in the wild, selection keeps the frequency close to the rate of mutation.

==Distribution and habitat==
[[File:Standing jaguar.jpg|thumb|The jaguar inhabits a variety of forested and open habitat, but is strongly associated with the presence of water.<ref name=CAP />]]
At present, the jaguar's range extends from [[Mexico]] through Central America to South America, including much of [[Amazonian Brazil]]. The countries included in this range are [[Argentina]], Belize, [[Bolivia]], [[Colombia]], Costa Rica (particularly on the [[Osa Peninsula]]), [[Ecuador]], [[French Guiana]], Guatemala, [[Guyana]], Honduras, Nicaragua, [[Panama]], Paraguay, [[Peru]], Suriname, the [[United States]] and [[Venezuela]].

Unfortunately the cessation of hunting came too late to save the jaguar population from crashing and no kittens have been known to have been born on the other side of the Mexican-American border in generations.

In 1996 and from 2004 on, hunting guides and wildlife officials in Arizona photographed and documented jaguars in the southern part of the state.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Dye|first1=Lee|title=Jaguars Moving Back Into U.S.|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=98074&page=1|website=abcnews.go.com|publisher=[[ABC News]]|accessdate=May 21, 2017|date=February 21, 2002}}</ref> Between 2004 and 2007, two or three jaguars have been reported by researchers around [[Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge]] in southern Arizona. One of them, called 'Macho B', had been previously photographed in 1996 in the area.<ref name="r24" /> For any permanent population in the US to thrive, protection from killing, an adequate prey base, and connectivity with Mexican populations are essential.<ref name="r25" /> In February 2009, a {{convert|53.5|kg|lb|abbr=on}} jaguar was caught, radio-collared and released in an area southwest of [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]], Arizona; this is farther north than had previously been expected and represents a sign there may be a permanent breeding population of jaguars within southern Arizona. The animal was later confirmed to be indeed the same male individual ('Macho B') that was photographed in 2004.<ref name="r26" /> On 2 March 2009, Macho B was recaptured and [[Animal euthanasia|euthanized]] after he was found to be suffering from kidney failure; the animal was thought to be 16 years old, older than any known wild jaguar.<ref name="r27" />

It is feared that completion of a [[United States–Mexico barrier]] may reduce the viability of any population currently residing in the United States, by reducing gene flow with Mexican populations, and may prevent any further northward expansion for the species.<ref name=r28/>

[[File:Aerial view of the Amazon Rainforest.jpg|thumb|The typical habitat at [[Amazon rainforest]]]]
The historic range of the species included much of the southern half of the United States, and in the south extended much farther to cover most of the South American continent. In total, its northern range has receded {{convert|1,000|km|mile|abbr=on}} southward and its southern range {{convert|2,000|km|mile|abbr=on}} northward. [[Last glacial period|Ice age]] fossils of the jaguar, dated between 40,000 and 11,500 years ago, have been discovered in the United States, including some at an important site as far north as [[Missouri]]. Fossil evidence shows jaguars of up to {{convert|190|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, much larger than the contemporary average for the animal.<ref name=MSI/>

The habitat of the cat typically includes the [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|rain forests]] of South and Central America, open, seasonally flooded wetlands, and dry grassland terrain. Of these habitats, the jaguar much prefers dense forest;<ref name=CAP/> the cat has lost range most rapidly in regions of drier habitat, such as the Argentine [[pampas]], the arid grasslands of Mexico, and the southwestern United States.<ref name="iucn"/> The cat will range across tropical, subtropical, and dry deciduous forests (including, historically, oak forests in the United States). The jaguar prefers to live by rivers, swamps, and in dense rainforest with thick cover for stalking prey. Jaguars have been found at elevations as high as 3,800&nbsp;m, but they typically avoid montane forest and are not found in the high [[Mexican Plateau|plateau]] of central Mexico or in the [[Andes]].<ref name=CAP/>  The jaguars preferred habitats are usually swamps and wooded regions, but jaguars also live in scrublands and deserts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/animal/jaguar-mammal|title=Jaguar|date=|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=}}</ref>

==Ecology and behavior==
===Ecological role===
The adult jaguar is an [[apex predator]], meaning it exists at the top of its food chain and is not preyed on in the wild. The jaguar has also been termed a [[keystone species]], as it is assumed, through controlling the population levels of prey such as [[Herbivore|herbivorous]] and [[Seed predation|granivorous]] mammals, apex felids maintain the structural integrity of forest systems.<ref name=foodhabits/><ref name=PHOENIX/> However, accurately determining what effect species like the jaguar have on ecosystems is difficult, because data must be compared from regions where the species is absent as well as its current habitats, while controlling for the effects of human activity. It is accepted that mid-sized prey species undergo population increases in the absence of the keystone predators, and this has been hypothesized to have cascading negative effects.<ref name=MONGA/> However, field work has shown this may be natural variability and the population increases may not be sustained. Thus, the [[keystone predator]] hypothesis is not accepted by all scientists.<ref name=r30/>

The jaguar also has an effect on other predators. The jaguar and the cougar, which is the next-largest feline of South America, but the biggest in Central or North America,<ref name=foodhabits/> are often [[sympatric]] (related species sharing overlapping territory) and have often been studied in conjunction. The jaguar tends to take larger prey, usually over {{convert|22|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and the cougar smaller, usually between {{convert|2|and|22|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, reducing the latter's size.<ref name="Brakefield"/><ref name=r31/> This situation may be advantageous to the cougar. Its broader prey niche, including its ability to take smaller prey, may give it an advantage over the jaguar in human-altered landscapes;<ref name=foodhabits/> while both are classified as [[near threatened|near-threatened]] species, the cougar has a significantly larger current distribution. Depending on the availability of prey, the cougar and jaguar may even share it.<ref name="GGLG2017">{{cite journal |last1=Gutiérrez-González |first1=Carmina E. |last2=López-González |first2=Carlos A. |title=Jaguar interactions with pumas and prey at the northern edge of jaguars' range |journal=PeerJ |volume=5 |pages=e2886 |url=https://peerj.com/articles/2886/ |date=2017-01-18 |access-date=2018-05-31|doi=10.7717/peerj.2886 |pmid=28133569 |pmc=5248577 }}</ref>

===Reproduction and life cycle===
[[File:Panthera onca zoo Salzburg 2009 06.jpg|thumbnail|4-month-old cub at the [[Salzburg Zoo]]]]
Jaguar females reach [[sexual maturity]] at about two years of age, and males at three or four.<!--the difference arises from competition for mates among males''.hide until sourced''--> The cat probably mates throughout the year in the wild, with births increasing when prey is plentiful.<ref name=MANUALREPRODUCTION/> Research on captive male jaguars supports the year-round [[mating]] hypothesis, with no seasonal variation in semen traits and ejaculatory quality; low reproductive success has also been observed in captivity.<ref name=r14/>

[[Generation time|Generation length]] of the jaguar is 9.8 years.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Generation length for mammals |author=Pacifici, M., Santini, L., Di Marco, M., Baisero, D., Francucci, L., Grottolo Marasini, G., Visconti, P. and Rondinini, C. |journal=Nature Conservation |year=2013 |issue=5 |pages=87–94}}</ref>

Female [[estrus]] is 6–17 days out of a full 37-day cycle, and females will advertise fertility with [[spraying (animal behavior)|urinary scent marks]] and increased vocalization.<ref name=MANUALREPRODUCTION/> Females range more widely than usual during courtship. [[Breeding pair|Pairs]] separate after mating, and females provide all parenting. The gestation period lasts 93–105 days; females give birth to up to four cubs, and most commonly to two. The mother will not tolerate the presence of males after the birth of cubs, given a risk of [[infanticide (zoology)|infanticide]]; this behavior is also found in the tiger.<ref name=MANUALHIST&BEHAV/>

The young are born blind, gaining sight after two weeks. Cubs are weaned at three months, but remain in the birth den for six months before leaving to accompany their mother on hunts.<ref name=SWWL/> They will continue in their mother's company for one to two years before leaving to establish a [[territory (animal)|territory]] for themselves. Young males are at first nomadic, jostling with their older counterparts until they succeed in claiming a territory. Typical lifespan in the wild is estimated at around 12–15 years; in captivity, the jaguar lives up to 23 years, placing it among the longest-lived [[felids|cats]].<ref name=JSSP/>

===Social activity===
[[File:Jaguars.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Jaguars at [[Cameron Park Zoo]] in [[Waco, Texas]]]]
Like most cats, the jaguar is solitary outside mother–cub groups. Adults generally meet only to court and mate (though limited noncourting socialization has been observed anecdotally<ref name=MANUALHIST&BEHAV/>) and carve out large territories for themselves. Female territories, which range from 25 to 40&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> in size, may overlap, but the animals generally avoid one another. Male ranges cover roughly twice as much area, varying in size with the availability of game and space, and do not overlap. The territory of a male can contain those of several females.<ref name=MANUALHIST&BEHAV/><ref name=r15/> The jaguar uses scrape marks, urine, and feces to [[Territorial marking|mark its territory]].<ref name=Rabinowitz/><ref>{{cite journal|title=Scrape-marking behavior of jaguars (Panthera onca) and pumas (Puma concolor)|first1=Bart J.|last1=Harmsen|first2=Rebecca J.|last2=Foster|first3=Said M.|last3=Gutierrez|first4=Silverio Y.|last4=Marin|first5=C. Patrick|last5=Doncaster|volume=91|issue=5|pages=1225–1234|doi=10.1644/09-mamm-a-416.1|journal=Journal of Mammalogy|bibcode = 2007JMamm..88..275L|year = 2007}}</ref>

Like the other big cats, the jaguar is capable of [[roaring]]<ref name=r16/><ref name=r17/> and does so to warn territorial and mating competitors away; intensive bouts of counter-calling between individuals have been observed in the wild.<ref name=Emmons1987/> Their roar often resembles a repetitive cough, and they may also vocalize mews and grunts.<ref name=JSSP/> Mating fights between males occur, but are rare, and aggression avoidance behavior has been observed in the wild.<ref name=Rabinowitz/> When it occurs, conflict is typically over territory: a male's range may encompass that of two or three females, and he will not tolerate intrusions by other adult males.<ref name=MANUALHIST&BEHAV/>

The jaguar is often described as [[nocturnal]], but is more specifically [[crepuscular]] (peak activity around dawn and dusk). Both sexes hunt, but males travel farther each day than females, befitting their larger territories. The jaguar may hunt during the day if game is available and is a relatively energetic feline, spending as much as 50–60 percent of its time active.<ref name=CAP/> The jaguar's elusive nature and the inaccessibility of much of its preferred habitat make it a difficult animal to sight, let alone study.

===Hunting and diet===
[[File:Panthera onca at the Toronto Zoo 2.jpg|thumb|right|The jaguar has an exceptionally powerful bite that allows it to pierce the shells of armored prey]]
Like all cats, the jaguar is an obligate [[carnivore]], feeding only on meat. It is an opportunistic hunter and its diet encompasses at least 87 species.<ref name=CAP/> The jaguar can take virtually any [[terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] or [[riparian]] [[vertebrate]] found in Central or South America, except for large crocodilians such as black caiman.  Jaguars are excellent swimmers and will dive under the water to catch turtles in rivers and the occasional fish. The jaguar is more of a dietary generalist than its Old World cousins: the American tropics have a high diversity of small animals but relatively low populations and diversity of the large [[ungulate]]s which this genus favors.<ref name= Brakefield>{{cite book |author=Brakefield, T. |year=1993 |isbn=978-0-89658-329-0 |title=''Big Cats: Kingdom of Might'' |location=}}</ref> They regularly take adult [[caiman]]s, except for black caimans,<ref name=r18/>  [[deer]], [[capybara]]s, [[tapir]]s, [[peccary|peccaries]], dogs, [[South American fox|zorros]], and sometimes even [[anaconda]]s.<ref name=Seymour/> However, it preys on any small species available, including [[frog]]s, [[mice]], [[bird]]s (mainly ground-based species such as [[Cracidae|cracids]]), [[fish]], [[sloth]]s, [[monkey]]s, and [[turtle]]s. A study conducted in [[Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary]] in Belize revealed that the diet of jaguars there consisted primarily of [[armadillo]]s and [[paca]]s.<ref name="Rabinowitz" /> Some jaguars will also take domestic livestock.<ref name=r19/> [[El Jefe (jaguar)|El Jefe]], one of the few jaguars that were reported in the United States,<ref name="NewsWeek2017">{{Cite news |work=Newsweek |title=Rare jaguar sighting in Arizona, 60 miles north of Mexican border |url=http://www.newsweek.com/rare-jaguar-sighting-arizona-60-miles-north-mexican-border-563133 |date=2017 |access-date=2017-03-03 |language=en}}</ref><ref name="SmithMag2016">{{cite journal |author=Richard Grant |title=The Return of the Great American Jaguar |journal=Smithsonian Magazine |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/return-great-american-jaguar-180960443/ |date=October 2016 |access-date=2016-10-02}}</ref> has also been found to kill and eat [[American black bears]], as deduced from hairs found within his scats and the partly consumed carcass of a black bear sow with the distinctive puncture marks to the skull left by jaguars. This indicates that jaguars might have once preyed on black bears when the species was still present in the area. [[Spectacled bears]] are also known to avoid jaguars, possibly because they may constitute occasional prey items.<ref name="Servheen1999">{{cite book |author=Servheen, C.; Herrero, S.; Peyton, B. |title=Bears: Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan |url=https://portals.iucn.org/library/sites/library/files/documents/1999-004.pdf |year=1999 |publisher=IUCN/SSC Bear Specialist Group |location=Missoula, Montana |isbn=978-2-8317-0462-3}}</ref> 

While the jaguar often employs the deep throat-bite and suffocation technique typical among ''Panthera'', it sometimes uses a killing method unique among cats: it pierces directly through the [[temporal bone]]s of the [[skull]] between the ears of prey (especially the capybara) with its [[canine tooth|canine teeth]], piercing the brain.<ref name=r20/> This may be an adaptation to "cracking open" turtle shells; following the late Pleistocene extinctions, armored reptiles such as turtles would have formed an abundant prey base for the jaguar.<ref name=Emmons1987/><ref name=CAP/> The skull bite is employed with mammals in particular; with reptiles such as the caiman, the jaguar may leap onto the back of the prey and sever the [[cervical vertebrae]], immobilizing the target. When attacking [[sea turtle]]s, including the huge [[leatherback sea turtle]] which weighs about {{convert|385|kg|lb|abbr=on}} on average, as they try to nest on beaches, the jaguar will bite at the head, often beheading the prey, before dragging it off to eat.<ref>''Travellers' Wildlife Guide to Costa Rica'' by Les Beletsky. Interlink Publishing Group (2004), {{ISBN|1566565294}}</ref> Reportedly, while hunting horses, a jaguar may leap onto their back, place one paw on the muzzle and another on the nape and then twist, dislocating the neck. Local people have anecdotally reported that when hunting a pair of horses bound together, the jaguar will kill one horse and then drag it while the other horse, still living, is dragged in their wake.<ref>''The animal kingdom: based upon the writings of the eminent naturalists Audubon, Wallace, Brehm, Wood, and Others'', edited by Hugh Craig. Trinity College (1897), New York.</ref>  With prey such as smaller dogs, a paw swipe to the skull may be sufficient to kill it.

[[File:Jagvstapir.jpg|thumb|Illustration of a jaguar killing a [[tapir]], the largest native land animal in its range]]
The jaguar is a stalk-and-ambush rather than a chase predator. The cat will walk slowly down forest paths, listening for and stalking prey before rushing or ambushing. The jaguar attacks from cover and usually from a target's blind spot with a quick pounce; the species' ambushing abilities are considered nearly peerless in the animal kingdom by both indigenous people and field researchers, and are probably a product of its role as an [[apex predator]] in several different environments. The ambush may include leaping into water after prey, as a jaguar is quite capable of carrying a large kill while swimming; its strength is such that carcasses as large as a heifer can be hauled up a tree to avoid flood levels.<ref name=MANUALHIST&BEHAV/>

On killing prey, the jaguar will drag the carcass to a thicket or other secluded spot. It begins eating at the neck and chest, rather than the midsection. The heart and lungs are consumed, followed by the shoulders.<ref name=MANUALHIST&BEHAV/> The daily food requirement of a {{convert|34|kg|lb|abbr=on}} animal, at the extreme low end of the species' weight range, has been estimated at {{convert|1.4|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.<ref name=FEDERAL/> For captive animals in the {{convert|50|-|60|kg|lb|abbr=on}} range, more than {{convert|2|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of meat daily are recommended.<ref name=r21/> In the wild, consumption is naturally more erratic; wild cats expend considerable energy in the capture and kill of prey, and they may consume up to {{convert|25|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of meat at one feeding, followed by periods of famine.<ref name=MANUALNUTRITION/> Though carnivorous, there is evidence that jaguars in the wild consume the roots of ''[[Banisteriopsis caapi]]''.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Reassessing the Cultural and Psychopharmacological Significance of ''Banisteriopsis caapi'': Preparation, Classification and Use Among the Piaroa of Southern Venezuela|journal=Journal of Psychoactive Drugs|volume=40|issue=3|year=2011|author=Robin Rood|pages=301–307|doi=10.1080/02791072.2008.10400645|pmid=19004422}}</ref>

====Attacks on humans====
{{Further|Man-eater}}
Jaguars very rarely attack humans. However, such behaviour appears to be more frequent where humans enter jaguar habitat and decrease prey.<ref name=r22/> Captive jaguars sometimes attack zookeepers.<ref name=r23/> When the [[conquistador]]s arrived in the Americas, they feared jaguars. Nevertheless, even in those times, the jaguar's chief prey was the capybara. [[Charles Darwin]] reported a saying of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] that people would not have to fear the jaguar much, as long as capybaras were abundant.<ref name="Porter1894">{{cite book |title=Wild beasts; a study of the characters and habits of the elephant, lion, leopard, panther, jaguar, tiger, puma, wolf, and grizzly bear |chapter=The Jaguar |author=Porter, J.

Jaguar populations are rapidly declining. The species is listed as [[near-threatened species|Near Threatened]] on the [[IUCN Red List]]. The loss of parts of its range, including its virtual elimination from its historic northern areas and the increasing fragmentation of the remaining range, have contributed to this status.<ref name=iucn/> Particularly significant declines occurred in the 1960s, when more than 15,000 jaguars were killed for their skins in the [[Brazilian Amazon]] yearly; the [[CITES|Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species]] of 1973 brought about a sharp decline in the pelt trade.<ref name=r32/> Detailed work performed under the auspices of the [[Wildlife Conservation Society]] revealed the species has lost 37% of its historic range, with its status unknown in an additional 18% of the global range. More encouragingly, the probability of long-term survival was considered high in 70% of its remaining range, particularly in the Amazon basin and the adjoining [[Gran Chaco]] and [[Pantanal]].<ref name=Sanderson2002>{{cite journal|last1=Sanderson |first1=E.

When adapted to the prey, the jaguar has been shown to take cattle as a large portion of its diet; while land clearance for grazing is a problem for the species, the jaguar population may have increased when cattle were first introduced to South America, as the animals took advantage of the new prey base. This willingness to take livestock has induced ranch owners to hire full-time jaguar hunters.<ref name=JSSP/>

The skins of wild cats and other mammals have been highly valued by the fur trade for many decades. From the beginning of the 20th-century Jaguars were hunted in large numbers, but over-harvest and habitat destruction reduced the availability and induced hunters and traders to gradually shift to smaller species by the 1960s. The international trade of jaguar skins had its largest boom between the end of the [[Second World War]] and the early 1970, due to the growing economy and lack of regulations. From 1967 onwards, the regulations introduced by national laws and international agreements diminished the reported international trade from as high as 13000 skins in 1967, through 7000 skins in 1969, until it became negligible after 1976, although illegal trade and smuggling continue to be a problem. During this period, the biggest exporters were Brazil and Paraguay, and the biggest importers were the US and [[Germany]].<ref name="SkinTrade">{{cite book |last1=Broad |first1=S- |title=The harvest of and trade in Latin American spotted cats (Felidae) and otters (Lutrinae) |date=1987|publisher=IUCN Conservation Monitoring Centre|location=Cambridge, UK|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/119261|accessdate=8 July 2016}}</ref>

===Jaguar Conservation Units===
Jaguar conservation is complicated because of the species' large range spanning 18 countries with different policies and regulations. Specific areas of high importance for jaguar conservation, so-called "Jaguar Conservation Units" (JCU) were determined in 2000. These are large areas inhabited by at least 50 jaguars. Each unit was assessed and evaluated on the basis of size, connectivity, habitat quality for both jaguar and prey, and jaguar population status. That way, 51 Jaguar Conservation Units were determined in 36 geographic regions as priority areas for jaguar conservation including:<ref name=Sanderson2002/>
* the [[Sierra Madre Occidental|Sierra Madre]] of Mexico
* the Selva Maya tropical forests extending over Mexico, Belize, and Guatemala
* the [[Chocó-Darién moist forests]] from Honduras, Panama to Colombia
* [[Sierra de Tamaulipas]]
* [[Venezuelan Llanos]]
* northern [[Cerrado]] and [[Amazon basin]] in Brazil
* [[Misiones Province]] in Argentina

Recent studies underlined that to maintain the robust exchange across the jaguar gene pool necessary for maintaining the species, it is important that jaguar habitats are interconnected. To facilitate this, a new project, the [[Paseo del Jaguar]], has been established to connect several jaguar hotspots.<ref name=r35/>

In 1986, the [[Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary]] was established in Belize as the world's first protected area for jaguar conservation.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Weckel, M., Giuliano, W. and Silver, S. |year=2006 |title=Cockscomb revisited: jaguar diet in the Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary, Belize |journal=Biotropica |volume=38 |issue=5 |pages=687–690 |url=|doi=10.1111/j.1744-7429.2006.00190.x }}</ref>

Given the inaccessibility of much of the species' range, particularly the central Amazon, estimating jaguar numbers is difficult. Researchers typically focus on particular [[bioregion]]s, thus species-wide analysis is scant. In 1991, 600–1,000 (the highest total) were estimated to be living in Belize. A year earlier, 125–180 jaguars were estimated to be living in Mexico's 4,000-km<sup>2</sup> (2400-mi<sup>2</sup>) [[Calakmul Biosphere Reserve]], with another 350 in the state of [[Chiapas]]. The adjoining [[Maya Biosphere Reserve]] in Guatemala, with an area measuring 15,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (9,000&nbsp;mi<sup>2</sup>), may have 465–550 animals.<ref name=GUIDELINESPOPULATION/> Work employing [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] [[telemetry]] in 2003 and 2004 found densities of only six to seven jaguars per 100&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> in the critical Pantanal region, compared with 10 to 11 using traditional methods; this suggests the widely used sampling methods may inflate the actual numbers of cats.<ref name=r34/>

===Approaches===
In setting up protected reserves, efforts generally also have to be focused on the surrounding areas, as jaguars are unlikely to confine themselves to the bounds of a reservation, especially if the population is increasing in size. Human attitudes in the areas surrounding reserves and laws and regulations to prevent poaching are essential to make conservation areas effective.<ref name=gutierrez/>

To estimate population sizes within specific areas and to keep track of individual jaguars, [[camera trap]]ping and [[Telemetry#Fishery and wildlife research and management|wildlife tracking telemetry]] are widely used, and feces may be sought out with the help of detector dogs to study jaguar health and diet.<ref name=soisalo/><ref name=furtado/>
Current conservation efforts often focus on educating ranch owners and promoting [[ecotourism]].<ref name=WWF/> The jaguar is generally defined as an [[umbrella species]] – its home range and habitat requirements are sufficiently broad that, if protected, numerous other species of smaller range will also be protected.<ref name=r33/> Umbrella species serve as "mobile links" at the landscape scale, in the jaguar's case through predation. Conservation organizations may thus focus on providing viable, connected habitat for the jaguar, with the knowledge other species will also benefit.<ref name=WWF/>

[[Ecotourism]] setups are being used to generate public interest in charismatic animals such as the jaguar, while at the same time generating revenue that can be used in conservation efforts. Audits done in Africa have shown that ecotourism has helped in African cat conservation. As with large African cats, a key concern in jaguar ecotourism is the considerable habitat space the species requires, so if ecotourism is used to aid in jaguar conservation, some considerations need to be made as to how existing ecosystems will be kept intact, or how new ecosystems that are large enough to support a growing jaguar population will be put into place.<ref name=mossaz/>

In [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] Central and South America, the jaguar was a symbol of power and strength. Among the [[Andes|Andean]] cultures, a jaguar cult disseminated by the early [[Chavín culture]] became accepted over most of what is today Peru by 900 BC. The later [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] culture of northern Peru used the jaguar as a symbol of power in many of their ceramics.<ref name=r41/><ref name=b1/><ref name=b2/> In the [[Muisca religion|religion]] of the [[Muisca Confederation|Muisca]], who inhabited the cool [[Altiplano Cundiboyacense]] in the [[Colombia]]n Andes, the jaguar was considered a sacred animal and during their religious rituals the people dressed in jaguar skins.<ref name=Ocampo_p231/> The skins were traded with the lowland peoples of the tropical [[Orinoquía Region|Llanos Orientales]].<ref name=Kruschek_p14/> The name of ''[[Muisca rulers|zipa]]'' [[Nemequene]] was derived from the [[Chibcha language|Muysccubun]] words ''nymy'' and ''quyne'', meaning "force of the jaguar".<ref name=nymy/><ref name=quyne/>

In [[Mesoamerica]], the [[Olmec]]—an early and influential culture of the [[Gulf Coast of Mexico|Gulf Coast region]] roughly contemporaneous with the Chavín—developed a distinct "[[Olmec were-jaguar|were-jaguar]]" motif of sculptures and figurines showing stylised jaguars or humans with jaguar characteristics. In the later [[Maya civilization]], the jaguar was believed to facilitate communication between the living and the dead and to protect the royal household. The Maya saw these powerful felines as their companions in the spiritual world, and a number of Maya rulers bore names that incorporated the Mayan word for jaguar (''b'alam'' in many of the [[Mayan languages]]). ''Balam'' (''Jaguar'') remains a common Maya surname, and it is also the name of [[Chilam Balam]], a legendary author to whom are attributed 17th and 18th-centuries Maya [[miscellanies]] preserving much important knowledge. The [[Aztec]] civilization shared this image of the jaguar as the representative of the ruler and as a warrior. The Aztecs formed an elite warrior class known as the [[Jaguar warrior|Jaguar Knights]]. In [[Aztec mythology]], the jaguar was considered to be the [[totem]] animal of the powerful deity [[Tezcatlipoca]].<ref name=MANUALHIST&BEHAV/><ref name=b3/>

===Contemporary culture===
The jaguar and its name are widely used as a symbol in contemporary culture. It is the [[List of national animals|national animal]] of [[Guyana]], and is featured in its [[Coat of arms of Guyana|coat of arms]].<ref name=r42/> The [[flag of the Department of Amazonas]], a Colombian department, features a black jaguar silhouette pouncing towards a hunter.<ref name=r43/> The jaguar also appears in banknotes of [[Brazilian real]]. The jaguar is also a common fixture in the mythology of many contemporary native cultures in South America,<ref name=r44/> usually being portrayed as the creature which gave humans the power over fire.

Jaguar is widely used as a product name, most prominently for a [[Jaguar Cars|British luxury car brand]]. The name has been adopted by sports franchises, including the [[National Football League|NFL]]'s [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] and the [[Primera División de México|Mexican]] [[association football|soccer]] club [[Chiapas F.C.]] The crest of [[Argentina]]'s [[Argentine Rugby Union|national federation]] in [[rugby union]] features a jaguar; however, [[Argentina national rugby union team#Colours and name|because of a journalist error]], the country's [[Argentina national rugby union team|national team]] is nicknamed ''Los Pumas''.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/5389512.stm |title=Puma power: Argentinian rugby |last=Davies |first=Sean |publisher=bbc.co.uk |accessdate=8 October 2007 |date=26 July 2007}}</ref> In the spirit of the ancient Mayan culture, the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Olympics]] in Mexico City adopted a red jaguar as the first official Olympic mascot.<ref name=r45/>
