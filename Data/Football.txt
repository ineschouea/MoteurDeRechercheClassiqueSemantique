'''Football''' is a family of [[team sport]]s that involve, to varying degrees, [[Kick (football)|kicking]] a [[Football (ball)|ball]] to score a [[Goal (sport)|goal]].  Unqualified, [[Football (word)|the word ''football'']] is understood to refer to whichever form of football is the most popular in the regional context in which the word appears. Sports commonly called ''football'' in certain places include [[association football]] (known as soccer in some countries); [[gridiron football]] (specifically [[American football]] or [[Canadian football]]); [[Australian rules football]]; [[rugby football]] (either [[rugby league]] or [[rugby union]]); and [[Gaelic football]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Reilly |first=Thomas |last2=Gilbourne |first2=D. |title=Science and football: a review of applied research in the football code |journal=Journal of Sports Sciences |year=2003 |volume=21 |issue=9 |pages=693–705 |doi=10.1080/0264041031000102105}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&objectid=11272089 |title=Editorial: Soccer – or should we say football – must change |date=12 June 2014 |quote=New Zealanders on the way to their local rugby grounds should still be talking of "going to the football"}}</ref> These different variations of football are known as '''football codes'''.

== Common elements ==
[[File:Men kicking footballs.webm|alt=Men kicking footballs|thumb|upright=1.25|Men kicking footballs]]
The various codes of football share certain common elements and can be grouped into two main classes of football: ''carrying'' codes like American football, Canadian football, rugby union and rugby league, where the ball is moved about the field while being held in the hands or thrown, and ''kicking'' codes such as Association football and Gaelic football, where the ball is moved primarily with the feet, and where handling is strictly limited.<ref name="Douge">{{cite book |last=Douge |first=Brian |title=Science and Football |year=2011 |publisher=Routledge |location=Abingdon |isbn=978-0-415-50911-4 |pages=3–19 |edition=Second |chapter=Football: the common threads between the games|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vCDBicFbsioC }}</ref>

Common rules among the sports include:<ref>{{Cite web |title=Law 1: The Field of Play - Football Rules & Governance {{!}} The FA|url = http://www.thefa.com/football-rules-governance/laws/football-11-11/law-1---the-field-of-play|website = www.thefa.com|accessdate = 27 September 2015|first = The Football|last = Association}}</ref>
* Two ''teams'' of usually between 11 and 18 players; some variations that have fewer players (five or more per team) are also popular.
* A clearly defined area in which to play the game.
* ''[[Score (sport)|Scoring]]'' ''[[goal (sport)|goals]]'' or ''points'' by moving the ball to an opposing team's end of the field and either into a goal area, or over a line.
* Goals or points resulting from players putting the ball between two ''[[goalposts]]''.
* The goal or line being ''defended'' by the opposing team.
* Players being required to move the ball—depending on the code—by kicking, carrying, or hand-passing the ball.
* Players using only their body to move the ball.

In all codes, common skills include [[Passing (sports)|passing]], [[Tackle (football move)|tackling]], evasion of tackles, catching and [[Kick (football)|kicking]].<ref name="Douge" /> In most codes, there are rules restricting the movement of players ''[[Offside (sport)|offside]]'', and players scoring a goal must put the ball either under or over a ''[[Goal (sport)|crossbar]]'' between the goalposts.

== Etymology ==
{{Main|Football (word)}}
There are conflicting explanations of the origin of the word "football".  It is widely assumed that the word "football" (or the phrase "foot ball") refers to the action of the foot kicking a ball.<ref>{{cite web |title=Football |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=football&allowed_in_frame=0 |publisher=Etymology Online |accessdate=14 December 2015}}</ref>  There is an alternative explanation, which is that football originally referred to a variety of games in [[medieval Europe]], which were played ''on foot''. There is no conclusive evidence for either explanation.

In ''kemari'' several people stand in a circle and kick a ball to each other, trying not to let the ball drop to the ground (much like [[keepie uppie]]).

The [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] are known to have played many ball games, some of which involved the use of the feet. The Roman game ''[[harpastum]]'' is believed to have been adapted from a [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] team game known as "?????????"

There are a number of references to traditional, [[ancient]], or [[prehistoric]] ball games, played by [[indigenous peoples]] in many different parts of the world. For example, in 1586, men from a ship commanded by an English explorer named [[John Davis (English explorer)|John Davis]], went ashore to play a form of football with [[Inuit]] (Eskimo) people in Greenland.<ref>Richard Hakluyt, [http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/h/hakluyt/northwest/chapter8.html Voyages in Search of The North-West Passage] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012191427/http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/h/hakluyt/northwest/chapter8.html |date=12 October 2008 }}, ''[[University of Adelaide]]'', 29 December 2003</ref> There are later accounts of an Inuit game played on ice, called ''Aqsaqtuk''. Each match began with two teams facing each other in parallel lines, before attempting to kick the ball through each other team's line and then at a goal. In 1610, [[William Strachey]], a colonist at [[Jamestown, Virginia]] recorded a game played by Native Americans, called ''Pahsaheman''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} On the [[Australian continent]] several tribes of [[indigenous Australians|indigenous people]] played kicking and catching games with stuffed balls which have been generalised by historians as ''[[Marn Grook]]'' ([[Djab Wurrung]] for "game ball"). The earliest historical account is an [[anecdote]] from the 1878 book by [[Robert Brough-Smyth]], ''The Aborigines of Victoria'', in which a man called Richard Thomas is quoted as saying, in about 1841 in [[Victoria, Australia]], that he had witnessed Aboriginal people playing the game: "Mr Thomas describes how the foremost player will drop kick a ball made from the skin of a [[Phalangeriformes|possum]] and how other players leap into the air in order to catch it." Some historians have theorised that ''Marn Grook'' was one of the [[Origins of Australian football|origins of]] [[Australian rules football]].

The [[M?ori people|M?ori]] in New Zealand played a game called [[Ki-o-rahi]] consisting of teams of seven players play on a circular field divided into zones, and score points by touching the 'pou' (boundary markers) and hitting a central 'tupu' or target.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

[[Mesoamerican ballgame|Games played in Mesoamerica]] with rubber balls by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]] are also well-documented as existing since before this time, but these had more similarities to [[basketball]] or [[volleyball]], and no links have been found between such games and modern football sports. Northeastern American Indians, especially the [[Iroquois]] Confederation, played a game which made use of net racquets to throw and catch a small ball; however, although it is a ball-goal foot game, [[lacrosse]] (as its modern descendant is called) is likewise not usually classed as a form of "football."{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

These games and others may well go far back into antiquity. However, the main sources of modern football codes appear to lie in western Europe, especially England.

The early forms of football played in England, sometimes referred to as "[[mob football]]", would be played between neighbouring towns and villages, involving an unlimited number of players on opposing teams who would clash ''en masse'',<ref>{{cite book |last=Dunning |first=Eric |title=Sport Matters: Sociological Studies of Sport, Violence and Civilisation |publisher=Routledge |year=1999 |page=89 |isbn=978-0-415-09378-1}}</ref> struggling to move an item, such as inflated animal's bladder<ref name="sportmatters">{{cite book |last=Dunning |first=Eric |title=Sport Matters: Sociological Studies of Sport, Violence and Civilisation |publisher=Routledge |year=1999 |page=88 |isbn=978-0-415-09378-1}}</ref> to particular geographical points, such as their opponents' church, with play taking place in the open space between neighbouring parishes.<ref>{{cite book |last=Baker |first=William |title=Sports in the Western World |publisher=University of Illinois Press |year=1988 |page=48 |isbn=978-0-252-06042-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rkuAiv3LoR4C }}</ref> The game was played primarily during significant religious festivals, such as Shrovetide, Christmas, or Easter,<ref name="sportmatters" /> and Shrovetide games have survived into the modern era in a number of English towns (see below).

The first detailed description of what was almost certainly football in England was given by [[William FitzStephen]] in about 1174–1183. He described the activities of London youths during the annual festival of [[Shrove Tuesday]]:
{{quote|After lunch all the youth of the city go out into the fields to take part in a ball game. The students of each school have their own ball; the workers from each city craft are also carrying their balls. Older citizens, fathers, and wealthy citizens come on horseback to watch their juniors competing, and to relive their own youth vicariously: you can see their inner passions aroused as they watch the action and get caught up in the fun being had by the carefree adolescents.<ref>Stephen Alsford, [http://www.trytel.com/~tristan/towns/florilegium/introduction/intro01.html#p25 FitzStephen's Description of London], ''Florilegium Urbanum'', April 5, 2006</ref>}}

Most of the very early references to the game speak simply of "ball play" or "playing at ball". This reinforces the idea that the games played at the time did not necessarily involve a ball being kicked.

An early reference to a ball game that was probably football comes from 1280 at [[Ulgham]], Northumberland, England:  "Henry... while playing at ball.. ran against David".<ref name=Magoun>Francis Peabody Magoun, 1929, "Football in Medieval England and Middle-English literature" (''The American Historical Review'', v. 35, No. 1).</ref>  Football was played in Ireland in 1308, with a documented reference to John McCrocan, a spectator at a "football game" at [[Newcastle, County Down]] being charged with accidentally stabbing a player named William Bernard.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.carlow-nationalist.ie/tabId/392/itemId/2418/Irish-inventions-fact-and-fiction.aspx |title=Irish inventions: fact and fiction |publisher=Carlow-nationalist.ie |date= |accessdate=16 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120729154246/http://www.carlow-nationalist.ie/tabId/392/itemId/2418/Irish-inventions-fact-and-fiction.aspx |archivedate=29 July 2012 |df=}}</ref>  Another reference to a football game comes in 1321 at [[Shouldham]], Norfolk, England: "[d]uring the game at ball as he kicked the ball, a lay friend of his... ran against him and wounded himself".<ref name="Magoun"/>

In 1314, [[Nicholas de Farndone]], [[Lord Mayor of the City of London]] issued a decree banning football in the French used by the English upper classes at the time. A translation reads: "[f]orasmuch as there is great noise in the city caused by hustling over large foot balls [''rageries de grosses pelotes de pee'']<ref>Derek Birley (Sport and The Making of Britain). 1993. Manchester University Press. p. 32. 978-0719037597</ref> in the fields of the public from which many evils might arise which God forbid: we command and forbid on behalf of the king, on pain of imprisonment, such game to be used in the city in the future." This is the earliest reference to football.

In 1363, King [[Edward III of England]] issued a proclamation banning "...handball, football, or hockey; coursing and cock-fighting, or other such idle games",<ref>Derek Baker (England in the Later Middle Ages). 1995. Boydell & Brewer. p. 187. {{ISBN|978-0-85115-648-4}}</ref> showing that "football" – whatever its exact form in this case – was being differentiated from games involving other parts of the body, such as handball.

A game known as "football" was played in Scotland as early as the 15th century: it was prohibited by the Football Act 1424 and although the law fell into disuse it was not repealed until 1906. There is evidence for schoolboys playing a "football" ball game in Aberdeen in 1633 (some references cite 1636) which is notable as an early allusion to what some have considered to be passing the ball. The word "pass" in the most recent translation is derived from "huc percute" (strike it here) and later "repercute pilam" (strike the ball again) in the original Latin. It is not certain that the ball was being struck between members of the same team. The original word translated as "goal" is "metum", literally meaning the "pillar at each end of the circus course" in a Roman chariot race. There is a reference to "get hold of the ball before [another player] does" (Praeripe illi pilam si possis agere) suggesting that handling of the ball was allowed. One sentence states in the original 1930 translation "Throw yourself against him" (Age, objice te illi).
[[File:Football gravure 1750.jpg|thumb|France circa 1750]]
King [[Henry IV of England]] also presented one of the earliest documented uses of the English word "football", in 1409, when he issued a proclamation forbidding the levying of money for "foteball".<ref name=Magoun/><ref name=Etymology>{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=football |title=Online Etymology Dictionary (no date), "football" |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=19 June 2010}}</ref>

There is also an account in [[Latin]] from the end of the 15th century of football being played at [[Cawston, Nottinghamshire]]. This is the first description of a "kicking game" and the first description of [[dribbling]]: "[t]he game at which they had met for common recreation is called by some the foot-ball game. It is one in which young men, in country sport, propel a huge ball not by throwing it into the air but by striking it and rolling it along the ground, and that not with their hands but with their feet... kicking in opposite directions" The chronicler gives the earliest reference to a football pitch, stating that: "[t]he boundaries have been marked and the game had started.<ref name=Magoun/>

Other firsts in the mediæval and [[early modern Europe|early modern]] eras:

* "a football", in the sense of a ball rather than a game, was first mentioned in 1486.<ref name=Etymology/> This reference is in Dame [[Juliana Berners]]' ''Book of [[St Albans]]''. It states: "a certain rounde instrument to play with ...it is an instrument for the foote and then it is calde in Latyn 'pila pedalis', a fotebal."<ref name=Magoun/>
* a pair of football boots were ordered by King [[Henry VIII of England]] in 1526.<ref>[http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1150460,00.html Vivek Chaudhary, "Who's the fat bloke in the number eight shirt?"] (''[[The Guardian]]'', 18 February 2004.)</ref>
* women playing a form of football was first described in 1580 by Sir [[Philip Sidney]] in one of his poems: "[a] tyme there is for all, my mother often sayes, When she, with skirts tuckt very hy, with girles at football playes."<ref>Anniina Jokinen, [http://www.luminarium.org/editions/sidneydialogue.htm Sir Philip Sidney. "A Dialogue Between Two Shepherds"] (''Luminarium.org'', July 2006)</ref>
* the first references to ''goals'' are in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. In 1584 and 1602 respectively, [[John Norden]] and [[Richard Carew (antiquary)|Richard Carew]] referred to "goals" in [[Cornish hurling]]. Carew described how goals were made: "they pitch two bushes in the ground, some eight or ten foote asunder; and directly against them, ten or twelue [twelve] score off, other twayne in like distance, which they terme their Goales".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/srvcr10.txt |title=EBook of The Survey of Cornwall |last=Richard |first=Carew |publisher=Project Gutenberg |accessdate=3 October 2007}}</ref> He is also the first to describe goalkeepers and passing of the ball between players.
* the first direct reference to ''scoring a goal'' is in [[John Day (dramatist)|John Day]]'s play ''[[The Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green]]'' (performed circa 1600; published 1659): "I'll play a gole at [[Camping (game)|camp-ball]]" (an extremely violent variety of football, which was popular in [[East Anglia]]). Similarly in a poem in 1613, [[Michael Drayton]] refers to "when the Ball to throw, And drive it to the Gole, in squadrons forth they goe".

=== Calcio Fiorentino ===
[[File:Calcio fiorentino 1688.jpg|right|thumb|An illustration of the ''Calcio Fiorentino'' field and starting positions, from a 1688 book by Pietro di Lorenzo Bini.]]
{{Main|Calcio Fiorentino}}
In the 16th century, the city of [[Florence]] celebrated the period between [[Epiphany (feast)|Epiphany]] and [[Lent]] by playing a game which today is known as "''calcio storico''" ("historic kickball") in the [[Piazza Santa Croce]]. The young aristocrats of the city would dress up in fine silk costumes and embroil themselves in a violent form of football. For example, ''calcio'' players could punch, shoulder charge, and kick opponents. Blows below the belt were allowed. The game is said to have originated as a military training exercise. In 1580, Count Giovanni de' Bardi di Vernio wrote ''Discorso sopra 'l giuoco del Calcio Fiorentino''. This is sometimes said to be the earliest code of rules for any football game. The game was not played after January 1739 (until it was revived in May 1930).

=== Official disapproval and attempts to ban football ===
{{Main|Attempts to ban football games}}
There have been many attempts to ban football, from the [[middle ages]] through to the modern day. The first such law was passed in England in 1314; it was followed by more than 30 in England alone between 1314 and 1667.<ref name="Women Football and Europe">{{cite book |isbn=9781841262253 |title=Women, Football and Europe: Histories, Equity and Experience | editor1-last = Magee | editor1-first= Jonathan |year=2007 |publisher=Meyer & Meyer Sport | editor2-last = Caudwell | editor2-first= Jayne | editor3-last = Liston | editor3-first= Kate | editor4-last = Scraton | editor4-first= Sheila |series=International Football Institute Series |volume=1 |pages=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yo2ZnpOQc7AC }}</ref>{{rp|6}} Football faced armed opposition in the 18th Century when used as a cover for violent protest against the [[enclosure act]].{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Women were banned from playing at English and Scottish Football League grounds in 1921, a ban that was only lifted in the 1970s. Female footballers still face similar problems in some parts of the world.

== Establishment of modern codes ==

=== English public schools ===
{{Main|English public school football games}}
While football continued to be played in various forms throughout Britain, its [[public school (England)|public schools]] (equivalent to private schools in other countries) are widely credited with four key achievements in the creation of modern football codes. First of all, the evidence suggests that they were important in taking football away from its "mob" form and turning it into an organised team sport. Second, many early descriptions of football and references to it were recorded by people who had studied at these schools. Third, it was teachers, students and former students from these schools who first codified football games, to enable matches to be played between schools. Finally, it was at English public schools that the division between "kicking" and "running" (or "carrying") games first became clear.

The earliest evidence that games resembling football were being played at English public schools – mainly attended by boys from the upper, upper-middle and professional classes – comes from the ''Vulgaria'' by William Herman in 1519. Herman had been headmaster at [[Eton College|Eton]] and [[Winchester College|Winchester]] colleges and his [[Latin]] textbook includes a translation exercise with the phrase "We wyll playe with a ball full of wynde".<ref>A history of Winchester College. by Arthur F Leach. Duckworth, 1899 {{ISBN|1-4446-5884-0}}</ref>

[[Richard Mulcaster]], a student at [[Eton College]] in the early 16th century and later headmaster at other English schools, has been described as "the greatest sixteenth Century advocate of football".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.footballnetwork.org/dev/historyoffootball/history8_18_3.asp |title=2003, "Richard Mulcaster" |publisher=Footballnetwork.org |date= |accessdate=19 June 2010}}</ref> Among his contributions are the earliest evidence of organised team football. Mulcaster's writings refer to teams ("sides" and "parties"), positions ("standings"), a referee ("judge over the parties") and a coach "(trayning maister)". Mulcaster's "footeball" had evolved from the disordered and violent forms of traditional football:

{{quote|[s]ome smaller number with such overlooking, sorted into sides and standings, not meeting with their bodies so boisterously to trie their strength: nor shouldring or shuffing one an other so barbarously ... may use footeball for as much good to the body, by the chiefe use of the legges.<ref>

In 1633, [[David Wedderburn (writer)|David Wedderburn]], a teacher from [[Aberdeen]], mentioned elements of modern football games in a short [[Latin]] textbook called ''Vocabula.'' Wedderburn refers to what has been translated into modern English as "keeping goal" and makes an allusion to passing the ball ("strike it here"). There is a reference to "get hold of the ball", suggesting that some handling was allowed. It is clear that the tackles allowed included the charging and holding of opposing players ("drive that man back").<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Shared Origins of Football, Rugby, and Soccer |last=Rowley |first=Christopher |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |year=2015 |isbn=9781442246195 |location= |pages=86 |via=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HmBoCgAAQBAJ }}</ref>

A more detailed description of football is given in [[Francis Willughby]]'s ''Book of Games'', written in about 1660.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P-io9DcBllkC&pg=PA168&lpg=PA168&vq=football&dq=willughby+book+of+sports |title=Francis Willughby, 1660–72, '&#39;Book of Games'&#39; |publisher= |date= |accessdate=19 June 2010 |isbn=978-1-85928-460-5 |year=2003}}</ref> Willughby, who had studied at [[Bishop Vesey's Grammar School]], [[Sutton Coldfield]], is the first to describe goals and a distinct playing field: "a close that has a gate at either end. The gates are called Goals." His book includes a diagram illustrating a football field. He also mentions tactics ("leaving some of their best players to guard the goal"); scoring ("they that can strike the ball through their opponents' goal first win") and the way teams were selected ("the players being equally divided according to their strength and nimbleness"). He is the first to describe a "law" of football: "they must not strike [an opponent's leg] higher than the ball".{{Citation needed|date=June 2009|reason=For all the quotes in this paragraph}}

English public schools were the first to codify football games. In particular, they devised the first ''[[offside (sport)|offside]]'' rules, during the late 18th century.<ref name=Carosi>[http://www.kenaston.org/download/KenAstonRefereeSociety/offside_history-JulianCarosi.pdf Julian Carosi, 2006, "The History of Offside"]</ref> In the earliest manifestations of these rules, players were "off their side" if they simply stood between the ball and the goal which was their objective. Players were not allowed to pass the ball forward, either by foot or by hand. They could only dribble with their feet, or advance the ball in a ''[[Scrum (rugby)|scrum]]'' or similar ''formation''. However, offside laws began to diverge and develop differently at each school, as is shown by the rules of football from Winchester, [[Rugby School|Rugby]], [[Harrow School|Harrow]] and [[Cheltenham School|Cheltenham]], during between 1810 and 1850.<ref name=Carosi/> The first known codes – in the sense of a set of rules – were those of Eton in 1815 <ref name="Richard William Cox 2002 243">{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of British Football |first=Richard William |last=Cox |first2=Dave |last2=Russell |first3=Wray |last3=Vamplew |publisher=Routledge |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-7146-5249-8 |page=243|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JKbb02bg6zYC }}</ref> and [[Aldenham]] in 1825.<ref name="Richard William Cox 2002 243"/>)

During the early 19th century, most working class people in Britain had to work six days a week, often for over twelve hours a day. They had neither the time nor the inclination to engage in sport for recreation and, at the time, many [[Child labour#Industrial Revolution|children were part of the labour force]]. [[Feast day]] football played on the streets was in decline. Public school boys, who enjoyed some freedom from work, became the inventors of organised football games with formal codes of rules.

Football was adopted by a number of public schools as a way of encouraging competitiveness and keeping youths fit. Each school drafted its own rules, which varied widely between different schools and were changed over time with each new intake of pupils. Two schools of thought developed regarding rules. Some schools favoured a game in which the ball could be carried (as at Rugby, [[Marlborough College|Marlborough]] and Cheltenham), while others preferred a game where kicking and dribbling the ball was promoted (as at Eton, Harrow, [[Westminster School|Westminster]] and [[Charterhouse School|Charterhouse]]). The division into these two camps was partly the result of circumstances in which the games were played. For example, Charterhouse and Westminster at the time had restricted playing areas; the boys were confined to playing their ball game within the school [[cloisters]], making it difficult for them to adopt rough and tumble running games.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009|reason=For the whole paragraph}}

[[File:Rugby School 850.jpg|thumb|left|[[Rugby School]] ]] [[William Webb Ellis]], a pupil at Rugby School, is said to have "with a fine disregard for the rules of football, ''as played in his time'' [emphasis added], first took the ball in his arms and ran with it, thus creating the distinctive feature of the rugby game." in 1823. This act is usually said to be the beginning of Rugby football, but there is little evidence that it occurred, and most sports historians believe the story to be apocryphal. The act of 'taking the ball in his arms' is often misinterpreted as 'picking the ball up' as it is widely believed that Webb Ellis' 'crime' was handling the ball, as in modern soccer, however handling the ball at the time was often permitted and in some cases compulsory,<ref>example of ball handling in early football from English writer [[William Hone]], writing in 1825 or 1826, quotes the social commentator Sir [[Frederick Morton Eden]], regarding "Foot-Ball", as played at [[Scone, Scotland|]], Scotland:
:''The game was this: he who at any time got the ball into his hands, run [sic] with it till overtaken by one of the opposite part; and then, if he could shake himself loose from those on the opposite side who seized him, he run on; if not, he threw the ball from him, unless it was wrested from him by the other party'', but no person was allowed to kick it. ([http://www.uab.edu/english/hone/etexts/edb/day-pages/046-february15.html William Hone, 1825–26, ''The Every-Day Book'', "February 15."] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080105043230/http://www.uab.edu/english/hone/etexts/edb/day-pages/046-february15.html |date=5 January 2008 }} Access date: 15 March 2007.)</ref> the rule for which Webb Ellis showed disregard was ''running forward with it'' as the rules of his time only allowed a player to retreat backwards or kick forwards.

[[Railway Mania|The boom in rail transport in Britain]] during the 1840s meant that people were able to travel further and with less inconvenience than they ever had before. Inter-school sporting competitions became possible. However, it was difficult for schools to play each other at football, as each school played by its own rules. The solution to this problem was usually that the match be divided into two halves, one half played by the rules of the host "home" school, and the other half by the visiting "away" school.

The ''modern'' rules of many football codes were formulated during the mid- or late- 19th century. This also applies to other sports such as lawn bowls, lawn tennis, etc. The major impetus for this was the patenting of the world's first [[lawnmower]] in 1830. This allowed for the preparation of modern ovals, playing fields, pitches, grass courts, etc.<ref>ABC Radio National ''Ockham's Razor'', first broadcast 6 June 2010.</ref>

Apart from Rugby football, the public school codes have barely been played beyond the confines of each school's playing fields. However, many of them are still played at the schools which created them (see [[Football#Surviving UK school games|Surviving UK school games]] below).

Public schools' dominance of sports in the UK began to wane after the [[Factory Act 1850|''Factory Act'' of 1850]], which significantly increased the recreation time available to working class children. Before 1850, many British children had to work six days a week, for more than twelve hours a day. From 1850, they could not work before 6&nbsp;a.m. (7&nbsp;a.m. in winter) or after 6&nbsp;p.m. on weekdays (7&nbsp;p.m. in winter); on Saturdays they had to cease work at 2&nbsp;p.m. These changes meant that working class children had more time for games, including various forms of football.

==== Clubs ====
{{Main|Oldest football clubs}}

Sports clubs dedicated to playing football began in the 18th century, for example [[The Gymnastic Society|London's Gymnastic Society]] which was founded in the mid-18th century and ceased playing matches in 1796.<ref>THE SURREY CLUB Bell's Life in London and Sporting Chronicle (London, England), Sunday, 7 October 1849; pg. 6. New Readerships</ref><ref>Football: The First Hundred Years. The Untold Story. Adrian Harvey. 2005. Routledge, London</ref>

The first documented club to bear in the title a reference to being a 'football club' were called "The Foot-Ball Club" who were located in [[Edinburgh]], Scotland, during the period 1824–41.<ref>John Hope, ''Accounts and papers of the football club kept by John Hope, WS, and some Hope Correspondence 1787–1886'' (National Archives of Scotland, GD253/183)</ref><ref name="Nas.gov.uk">{{cite web |url=http://www.nas.gov.uk/about/071112.asp |title=The Foot-Ball Club in Edinburgh, 1824–1841 – The National Archives of Scotland |publisher=Nas.gov.uk |date=13 November 2007 |accessdate=19 June 2010}}</ref>  The club forbade tripping but allowed pushing and holding and the picking up of the ball.<ref name="Nas.gov.uk"/>

In 1845, three boys at Rugby school were tasked with codifying the rules then being used at the school. These were the first set of written rules (or code) for any form of football.<ref>{{cite web |title=Rugby chronology |work=Museum of Rugby |url=http://www.rfu.com/microsites/museum/page.aspx?section=89&sectionTitle=World+Rugby+Chronology |accessdate=24 April 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121094425/http://www.rfu.com/microsites/museum/page.aspx?section=89&sectionTitle=World%2BRugby%2BChronology |archivedate=21 November 2008 |df=}}</ref> This further assisted the spread of the Rugby game.

==== Competitions ====
{{Main|Oldest football competitions}}

One of the longest running football fixture is the [[Cordner-Eggleston Cup]], contested between [[Melbourne Grammar School]] and [[Scotch College, Melbourne]] every year since 1858. It is believed by many to also be the first match of [[Australian rules football]], although it was played under experimental rules in its first year. The first football trophy tournament was the Caledonian Challenge Cup, donated by the Royal [[Caledonians|Caledonian]] Society of Melbourne, played in 1861 under the [[Melbourne Rules]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.electricscotland.com/history/australia/melbourne.htm |title=History of the Royal Caledonian Society of Melbourne |publisher=Electricscotland.com |date= |accessdate=19 June 2010}}</ref>  The oldest football league is a rugby football competition, the [[United Hospitals Challenge Cup]] (1874), while the oldest rugby trophy is the [[Yorkshire Cup (rugby union)|Yorkshire Cup]], contested since 1878. The [[South Australian Football Association]] (30 April 1877) is the oldest surviving Australian rules football competition. The oldest surviving soccer trophy is the [[Youdan Cup]] (1867) and the oldest national football competition is the English FA Cup (1871).   [[The Football League]] (1888) is recognised as the longest running Association Football league. The [[England v Scotland (1870)|first ''ever'' international football match]] took place between sides representing England and Scotland on 5 March 1870 at [[the Oval]] under the authority of the FA. The first Rugby international took place in 1871.

[[File:Richard Lindon (1816-1887).jpg|upright|thumb|[[Richard Lindon]] (seen in 1880) is believed to have invented the first footballs with rubber bladders.]] In Europe, early footballs were made out of animal [[urinary bladder|bladders]], more specifically [[Pig bladder|pig's bladders]], which were inflated. Later leather coverings were introduced to allow the balls to keep their shape.<ref>[http://www.soccerballworld.com/History.htm#Early Soccer Ball World – Early History].

Richard Lindon's wife is said to have died of lung disease caused by blowing up pig's bladders.<ref>The exact name of Mr Lindon is in dispute, as well as the exact timing of the creation of the inflatable bladder. It is known that he created this for both association and rugby footballs. However, sites devoted to football indicate he was known as [https://web.archive.org/web/20070311213720/http://www.richardlindon.com/ HJ Lindon], who was actually Richard Lindon's son, and created the ball in 1862 (ref: [http://www.soccerballworld.com/History.htm Soccer Ball World]), whereas rugby sites refer to him as [[Richard Lindon]] creating the ball in 1870 (ref: [http://observer.guardian.co.uk/osm/story/0,,1699545,00.html Guardian article]). Both agree that his wife died when inflating pig's bladders. This information originated from web sites which may be unreliable, and the answer may only be found in researching books in central libraries.</ref> Lindon also won medals for the invention of the "Rubber inflatable Bladder" and the "Brass Hand Pump".

In 1855, the U.S. inventor [[Charles Goodyear]] – who had patented [[vulcanized rubber|vulcanised rubber]] – exhibited a spherical football, with an exterior of vulcanised rubber panels, at the [[Exposition Universelle (1855)|Paris ''Exhibition Universelle'']]. The ball was to prove popular in early forms of football in the U.S.A.<ref>[http://www.soccerballworld.com/Oldestball.htm soccerballworld.com, (no date) "Charles Goodyear's Soccer Ball"] Downloaded 30/11/06.</ref>

The iconic ball with a regular pattern of hexagons and pentagons (see [[truncated icosahedron]]) did not become popular until the 1960s, and was first used in the World Cup [[1970 FIFA World Cup|in 1970]].

==== Modern ball passing tactics ====
{{Main|Passing (association football)}}

The earliest reference to a game of football involving players passing the ball and attempting to score past a goalkeeper was written in 1633 by David Wedderburn, a poet and teacher in [[Aberdeen]], Scotland.<ref>[http://www.scotsman.com/news/scottish-news/edinburgh-east-fife/scots_invented_beautiful_game_1_1121849 Scots invented beautiful game] The Scotsman, 14 June 2006</ref>  Nevertheless, the original text does not state whether the allusion to passing as 'kick the ball back' ('Repercute pilam') was in a forward or backward direction or between members of the same opposing teams (as was usual at this time)<ref>Magoun, Francis Peabody (1938).

=== Cambridge rules ===
{{Main|Cambridge rules}}
In 1848, at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]], [[H. de Winton]] and [[J. C. Thring]], who were both formerly at [[Shrewsbury School]], called a meeting at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], with 12 other representatives from Eton, Harrow, Rugby, [[Winchester College|Winchester]] and Shrewsbury. An eight-hour meeting produced what amounted to the first set of modern rules, known as the ''Cambridge rules''. No copy of these rules now exists, but a revised version from circa 1856 is held in the library of Shrewsbury School.<ref>
{{cite web |title=Football Association tribute to the Cambridge Rules |url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/news/football-association-tribute-to-the-cambridge-rules |accessdate=5 January 2015}}
</ref> The rules clearly favour the kicking game. Handling was only allowed ''when a player catches the ball directly from the foot'' entitling them to a free kick and there was a primitive offside rule, disallowing players from "loitering" around the opponents' goal. The Cambridge rules were not widely adopted outside English public schools and universities (but it was arguably the most significant influence on [[the Football Association]] committee members responsible for formulating the rules of Association football).

=== Sheffield rules ===
{{Main|Sheffield rules}}
By the late 1850s, many football clubs had been formed throughout the English-speaking world, to play various codes of football. [[Sheffield F.C.|Sheffield Football Club]], founded in 1857 in the English city of [[Sheffield]] by Nathaniel Creswick and William Prest, was later recognised as the world's oldest club playing association football.<ref name="Football, the First Hundred Years">{{cite book |first=Adrian |last=Harvey |title=Football, the First Hundred Years |year=2005 |pages=95–99 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-35019-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TxoZ0S-GC7MC}}</ref>
However, the club initially played its own code of football: the ''Sheffield rules''. The code was largely independent of the public school rules, the most significant difference being the lack of an ''offside'' rule.

The code was responsible for many innovations that later spread to association football. These included [[wikt:free kick|free kick]]s, [[corner kick]]s, handball, [[throw-in]]s and the crossbar.<ref>{{cite book |first=Brendan |last=Murphy |title=From Sheffield with Love |year=2007 |pages=41–43 |publisher=Sports Book Limited |isbn=978-1-899807-56-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D9PVkQEACAAJ }}</ref> By the 1870s they became the dominant code in the north and midlands of England. At this time a series of rule changes by both the [[The Football Association|London]] and [[Sheffield and Hallamshire County Football Association|Sheffield]] FAs gradually eroded the differences between the two games until the adoption of a common code in 1877.

=== Australian rules ===

{{See also|Origins of Australian rules football}}
[[File:Tom Wills 1857.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Tom Wills]], widely regarded as the father of Australian football]]
There is archival evidence of "foot-ball" games being played in various parts of Australia throughout the first half of the 19th century. The origins of an organised game of football known today as Australian rules football can be traced back to 1858 in [[Melbourne]], the capital city of [[Victoria (state)|Victoria]].

In July 1858, [[Tom Wills]], an Australian-born cricketer educated at [[Rugby School]] in England, wrote a letter to ''[[Bell's Life in Victoria|Bell's Life in Victoria & Sporting Chronicle]]'', calling for a "foot-ball club" with a "code of laws" to keep cricketers fit during winter.<ref>{{cite web |title=Letter from Tom Wills |work=MCG website |url=http://www.mcg.org.au/default.asp?pg=footballdisplay&articleid=37 |accessdate=14 July 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060625081726/http://www.mcg.org.au/default.asp?pg=footballdisplay&articleid=37 |archivedate=25 June 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=}}</ref> This is considered by historians to be a defining moment in the creation of Australian rules football.

One week later, Wills umpired a schoolboys match between [[Melbourne Grammar School]] and [[Scotch College (Melbourne)|Scotch College]]. Following these matches, organised football in Melbourne rapidly increased in popularity.

[[File:Australianfootball1866.jpg|thumb|Wood engraving of an Australian rules football match at the [[Yarra Park|Richmond Paddock]], [[Melbourne]], 1866]]
Wills and others involved in these early matches formed the [[Melbourne Football Club]] (the oldest surviving Australian football club) on 14 May 1859. Club members Wills, [[William Hammersley]], [[J. B. Thompson]] and [[Thomas H. Smith]] met with the intention of forming a set of rules that would be widely adopted by other clubs. The committee debated rules used in English public school games; Wills pushed for various [[rugby football]] rules he learnt during his schooling. The first rules share similarities with these games, and were shaped to suit to Australian conditions. [[H. C. A. Harrison]], a seminal figure in Australian football, recalled that his cousin Wills wanted "a game of our own".<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Hibbins |first1=Gillian |last2=Mancini |first2=Anne |title=Running with the Ball: Football's Foster Father |publisher=Lynedoch Publications |year=1987 |pages=118–119 |isbn=978-0-7316-0481-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oR3wAAAAMAAJ }}</ref> The code was distinctive in the prevalence of the [[Mark (Australian football)|mark]], [[Free kick (Australian rules football)|free kick]], [[Tackle (football move)#Australian rules football|tackling]], lack of an offside rule and that players were specifically penalised for [[Handball (Australian rules football)|throwing the ball]].

The Melbourne football rules were widely distributed and gradually adopted by the other Victorian clubs. The rules were updated several times during the 1860s to accommodate the rules of other influential Victorian football clubs. A significant redraft in 1866 by H. C. A. Harrison's committee accommodated the [[Geelong Football Club]]'s rules, making the game then known as "Victorian Rules" increasingly distinct from other codes. It soon adopted cricket fields and an oval ball, used specialised goal and behind posts, and featured [[running bounce|bouncing the ball while running]] and [[specky|spectacular high marking]]. The game spread quickly to other [[Australian states and territories|Australian colonies]]. Outside its heartland in southern Australia, the code experienced a significant period of decline following World War I but has since grown throughout Australia and in [[Australian football around the world|other parts of the world]], and the [[Australian Football League]] emerged as the dominant professional competition.

During the early 1860s, there were increasing attempts in England to unify and reconcile the various public school games. In 1862, J. C. Thring, who had been one of the driving forces behind the original Cambridge Rules, was a master at [[Uppingham School]] and he issued his own rules of what he called "The Simplest Game" (these are also known as the Uppingham Rules). In early October 1863 another new revised version of the Cambridge Rules was drawn up by a seven member committee representing former pupils from Harrow, Shrewsbury, Eton, Rugby, Marlborough and Westminster.

At the [[Freemasons' Tavern]], Great Queen Street, London on the evening of 26 October 1863, representatives of several football clubs in the [[County of London|London Metropolitan area]] met for the inaugural meeting of [[The Football Association]] (FA). The aim of the Association was to establish a single unifying code and regulate the playing of the game among its members. Following the first meeting, the public schools were invited to join the association. All of them declined, except Charterhouse and Uppingham. In total, six meetings of the FA were held between October and December 1863. After the third meeting, a draft set of rules were published. However, at the beginning of the fourth meeting, attention was drawn to the recently published Cambridge Rules of 1863. The Cambridge rules differed from the draft FA rules in two significant areas; namely running with (carrying) the ball and [[hacking (rugby)|hacking]] (kicking opposing players in the shins). The two contentious FA rules were as follows:

{{quote|IX. A player shall be entitled to run with the ball towards his adversaries' goal if he makes a fair catch, or catches the ball on the first bound; but in case of a fair catch, if he makes his mark he shall not run.<br /><!--Leave it here: two rules, two lines. -->
X. If any player shall run with the ball towards his adversaries' goal, any player on the opposite side shall be at liberty to charge, hold, trip or hack him, or to wrest the ball from him, but no player shall be held and hacked at the same time.<ref>Peter Shortell. [http://clubs.rfu.com/Clubs/portals/cornwallreferees/ThoughtsforRefs6667.aspx  Hacking – a history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080403122555/http://clubs.rfu.com/Clubs/portals/cornwallreferees/ThoughtsforRefs6667.aspx |date=2008-04-03 }}, [http://clubs.rfu.com/Clubs/portals/cornwallreferees/CRRSHistory6515.aspx Cornwall Referees Society]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080303044805/http://clubs.rfu.com/Clubs/portals/cornwallreferees/CRRSHistory6515.aspx |date=3 March 2008 }}, 2 October 2006</ref>}}

At the fifth meeting it was proposed that these two rules be removed. Most of the delegates supported this, but [[F. M. Campbell]], the representative from [[Blackheath Rugby Club|Blackheath]] and the first FA treasurer, objected. He said: "hacking is the true football". However, the motion to ban running with the ball in hand and hacking was carried and Blackheath withdrew from the FA. After the final meeting on 8 December, the FA published the "[[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of Football]]", the first comprehensive set of rules for the game later known as Association Football. The term "soccer", in use since the late 19th century, derives from an [[Oxford "-er"|Oxford University abbreviation]] of "Association".<ref name=OEDsoccer>{{cite journal |date=June 2011 |title=soccer, n |journal=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |volume= |issue= |pages= |url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/183733 |accessdate=1 July 2011}}</ref>

The first FA rules still contained elements that are no longer part of association football, but which are still recognisable in other games (such as Australian football and rugby football): for instance, a player could make a fair catch and claim a ''[[Mark (Australian football)|mark]]'', which entitled him to a free kick; and if a player touched the ball behind the opponents' goal line, his side was entitled to a ''free kick'' at goal, from 15&nbsp;yards (13.5&nbsp;metres) in front of the goal line.

=== Rugby football ===
{{Main|History of rugby union}}
[[File:Football London Ilustrated News.gif|thumb|A rugby scrum in 1871]]
In [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], by 1870, there were about 75 clubs playing variations of the Rugby school game. There were also "rugby" clubs in Ireland, Australia, Canada and New Zealand. However, there was no generally accepted set of rules for rugby until 1871, when 21 clubs from London came together to form the [[Rugby Football Union]] (RFU). The first official RFU rules were adopted in June 1871. These rules allowed passing the ball. They also included the [[try]], where touching the ball over the line allowed an attempt at goal, though drop-goals from marks and general play, and penalty conversions were still the main form of contest.

=== North American football codes ===
{{Main|History of American football|Canadian football#History}}

As was the case in Britain, by the early 19th century, North American schools and universities played their own local games, between sides made up of students. For example, students at [[Dartmouth College]] in [[New Hampshire]] played a game called [[Old division football]], a variant of the association football codes, as early as the 1820s.<ref name=ODF>{{cite web |last=Meacham |first=Scott |title=Old Division Football, The Indigenous Mob Soccer Of Dartmouth College (pdf) |publisher=dartmo.com |year=2006 |url=http://www.dartmo.com/football/Football_Meacham.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=16 May 2007}}</ref> They remained largely "[[mob football]]" style games, with huge numbers of players attempting to advance the ball into a goal area, often by any means necessary. Rules were simple, violence and injury were common.<ref name=PFRA1>{{cite web |title=No Christian End! |work=The Journey to Camp: The Origins of American Football to 1889 |publisher=Professional Football Researchers Association |url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Articles/No_Christian_End.pdf |accessdate=26 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611173624/https://www.profootballresearchers.org/Articles/No_Christian_End.pdf |archivedate=11 June 2014 |df=}}</ref> The violence of these mob-style games led to widespread protests and a decision to abandon them. [[Yale University]], under pressure from the city of [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], banned the play of all forms of football in 1860, while [[Harvard University]] followed suit in 1861.<ref name=PFRA1/> In its place, two general types of football evolved: "kicking" games and "running" (or "carrying") games. A hybrid of the two, known as the "[[Boston Game|Boston game]]", was played by a group known as the [[Oneida Football Club]]. The club, considered by some historians as the first formal [[football club]] in the United States, was formed in 1862 by schoolboys who played the "Boston game" on [[Boston Common]].<ref name=PFRA1/><ref>{{cite web |last=Allaway |first=Roger |title=Were the Oneidas playing soccer or not? |work=The USA Soccer History Archives |publisher=Dave Litterer |year=2001 |url=http://www.sover.net/~spectrum/oneidas.html |accessdate=15 May 2007}}</ref> The game began to return to American college campuses by the late 1860s. The universities of Yale, [[Princeton University|Princeton]] (then known as the College of New Jersey), [[Rutgers University|Rutgers]], and [[Brown University|Brown]] all began playing "kicking" games during this time. In 1867, Princeton used rules based on those of the English [[The Football Association|Football Association]].<ref name=PFRA1/>

In Canada, the first documented football match was a practice game played on 9 November 1861, at [[University College, University of Toronto]] (approximately 400 yards west of Queen's Park). One of the participants in the game involving University of Toronto students was (Sir) William Mulock, later Chancellor of the school.<ref name=1860s>{{cite web |url=https://www.cfl.ca/page/his_timeline_1860 |work=Official Site of the Canadian Football League |title=Timeline 1860s |publisher=Canadian Football League |accessdate=13 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100501160230/http://www.cfl.ca/page/his_timeline_1860 |archivedate=1 May 2010 |df=}}</ref>  In 1864, at [[University of Trinity College|Trinity College]], Toronto, F.

On 6 November 1869, Rutgers faced Princeton in a game that was played with a round ball and, like all early games, used improvised rules. It is usually regarded as [[1869 New Jersey vs. Rutgers football game|the first game of American intercollegiate football]].<ref name=PFRA1/><ref>{{cite web |title=1800s |work=Rutgers Through The Years |publisher=Rutgers University |url=http://ruweb.rutgers.edu/timeline/1800.htm |accessdate=16 May 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070120202924/http://ruweb.rutgers.edu/timeline/1800.htm |archivedate=20 January 2007 |df=}}</ref>

Modern North American football grew out of a match between [[McGill University]] of Montreal and Harvard University in 1874. During the game, the two teams alternated between the rugby-based rules used by McGill and the Boston Game rules used by Harvard.<ref>{{cite web |title=No Christian End!

[[File:1882RutgersFootballTeam.jpg|thumb|left|Rutgers College Football Team, 1882]]
In 1880, Yale coach [[Walter Camp]], who had become a fixture at the Massasoit House conventions where the rules were debated and changed, devised a number of major innovations. Camp's two most important rule changes that diverged the American game from rugby were replacing the [[Scrum (rugby)|scrummage]] with the ''[[line of scrimmage]]'' and the establishment of the ''[[Down (American and Canadian football)|down-and-distance]]'' rules.<ref name=PFRA2/> American football still however remained a violent sport where collisions often led to serious injuries and sometimes even death.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bennett |first=Tom |title=The Pro Style: The Complete Guide to Understanding National Football League Strategy |publisher=National Football League Properties, Inc., Creative Services Division |location=Los Angeles |year=1976 |page=20}}</ref> This led U.S. President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] to hold a meeting with football representatives from Harvard, Yale, and Princeton on 9 October 1905, urging them to make drastic changes.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Tiny Maxwell and the Crisis of 1905: The Making of a Gridiron Myth |journal=College Football Historical Society |volume= |issue= |year=2001 |pages=54–57 |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/NASSH_Proceedings/NP2001/NP2001zn.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100808041801/http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/NASSH_Proceedings/NP2001/NP2001zn.pdf |deadurl=yes |archive-date=8 August 2010 |authors=Watterson, John}}</ref> One rule change introduced in 1906, devised to open up the game and reduce injury, was the introduction of the legal [[forward pass]].

Over the years, Canada absorbed some of the developments in American football in an effort to distinguish it from a more rugby-oriented game. In 1903, the [[Ontario Rugby Football Union]] adopted the [[Burnside rules]], which implemented the ''line of scrimmage'' and ''down-and-distance'' system from American football, among others.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://greycup.cfl.ca/page/grey-cup-history-timeline-1900 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=18 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120922201718/http://greycup.cfl.ca/page/grey-cup-history-timeline-1900 |archivedate=22 September 2012 |df=}} History of the Grey Cup</ref> Canadian football then implemented the legal forward pass in 1929.<ref>[https://www.cfl.ca/page/his_timeline_1920 CFL.ca History, Timeline, 1920] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100625000000/http://www.cfl.ca/page/his_timeline_1920 |date=25 June 2010 }}</ref> American and Canadian football [[Comparison of American and Canadian football|remain different codes]], stemming from rule changes that the American side of the border adopted but the Canadian side has not.

=== Gaelic football ===
[[File:Croke Park from the hill.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|All-Ireland Football Final]] in [[Croke Park]], 2004.]]
{{Main|Gaelic football#History|l1=History of Gaelic football}}
In the mid-19th century, various traditional football games, referred to collectively as ''[[caid (sport)|caid]]'', remained popular in Ireland, especially in [[County Kerry]]. One observer, Father W. Ferris, described two main forms of ''caid'' during this period: the "field game" in which the object was to put the ball through arch-like goals, formed from the boughs of two trees; and the epic "cross-country game" which took up most of the daylight hours of a Sunday on which it was played, and was won by one team taking the ball across a parish boundary. "Wrestling", "holding" opposing players, and carrying the ball were all allowed.

By the 1870s, Rugby and Association football had started to become popular in Ireland. [[Trinity College, Dublin]] was an early stronghold of Rugby (see the [[Football#Other developments in the 1850s|Developments in the 1850s]] section, above). The rules of the English FA were being distributed widely. Traditional forms of ''caid'' had begun to give way to a "rough-and-tumble game" which allowed tripping.

There was no serious attempt to unify and codify Irish varieties of football, until the establishment of the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] (GAA) in 1884. The GAA sought to promote traditional Irish sports, such as [[hurling]] and to reject imported games like Rugby and Association football. The first Gaelic football rules were drawn up by [[Maurice Davin]] and published in the ''United Ireland'' magazine on 7 February 1887. Davin's rules showed the influence of games such as hurling and a desire to formalise a distinctly Irish code of football. The prime example of this differentiation was the lack of an offside rule (an attribute which, for many years, was shared only by other Irish games like hurling, and by Australian rules football).

===  Schism in Rugby football ===
[[File:Reverend marshall.jpg|thumb|An English cartoon from the 1890s lampooning the divide in rugby football which led to the formation of [[rugby league]]. The caricatures are of Rev. Frank Marshall, an arch-opponent of player payments, and James Miller, a long-time opponent of Marshall. The caption reads:

Marshall: "Oh, fie, go away naughty boy, I don't play with boys who can’t afford to take a holiday for football any day they like!"

Miller: "Yes, that's just you to a T; you’d make it so that no lad whose father wasn’t a millionaire could play at all in a really good team. For my part I see no reason why the men who make the money shouldn’t have a share in the spending of it."]]
{{Further|History of rugby league}}
The [[International Rugby Board|International Rugby Football Board]] (IRFB) was founded in 1886, but rifts were beginning to emerge in the code. [[professional sports|Professionalism]] had already begun to creep into the various codes of football.

In England, by the 1890s, a long-standing [[Rugby Football Union]] ban on ''professional'' players was causing regional tensions within rugby football, as many players in northern England were working class and could not afford to take time off to train, travel, play and recover from injuries. This was not very different from what had occurred ten years earlier in soccer in Northern England but the authorities reacted very differently in the RFU, attempting to alienate the working class support in Northern England. In 1895, following a dispute about a player being paid broken time payments, which replaced wages lost as a result of playing rugby, representatives of the northern clubs met in [[Huddersfield]] to form the [[Rugby Football League|Northern Rugby Football Union]] (NRFU). The new body initially permitted only various types of player wage replacements. However, within two years, NRFU players could be paid, but they were required to have a job outside sport.

The demands of a professional league dictated that rugby had to become a better "spectator" sport. Within a few years the NRFU rules had started to diverge from the RFU, most notably with the abolition of the ''[[line-out (rugby union)|line-out]]''. This was followed by the replacement of the ''[[Playing rugby union#Ruck|ruck]]'' with the "play-the-ball ruck", which allowed a two-player ruck contest between the tackler at marker and the player tackled. ''[[Rugby union gameplay#Maul|Mauls]]'' were stopped once the ball carrier was held, being replaced by a play-the ball-ruck. The separate Lancashire and Yorkshire competitions of the NRFU merged in 1901, forming the ''Northern Rugby League'', the first time the name [[rugby league]] was used officially in England.

Over time, the RFU form of rugby, played by clubs which remained members of national federations affiliated to the IRFB, became known as [[rugby union]].

=== Globalisation of association football ===
{{Main|History of FIFA}}
The need for a single body to oversee association football had become apparent by the beginning of the 20th century, with the increasing popularity of international fixtures. The English Football Association had chaired many discussions on setting up an international body, but was perceived as making no progress. It fell to associations from seven other European countries: France, Belgium, Denmark, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland, to form an international association. The ''Fédération Internationale de Football Association'' ([[FIFA]]) was founded in Paris on 21 May 1904. Its first president was [[Robert Guérin]]. The French name and acronym has remained, even outside French-speaking countries.

=== Further divergence of the two rugby codes ===
Rugby league rules diverged significantly from rugby union in 1906, with the reduction of the team from 15 to 13 players. In 1907, a New Zealand professional rugby team toured Australia and Britain, receiving an enthusiastic response, and professional [[rugby league in Australia|rugby leagues were launched in Australia]] the following year. However, the rules of professional games varied from one country to another, and negotiations between various national bodies were required to fix the exact rules for each international match. This situation endured until 1948, when at the instigation of the French league, the [[Rugby League International Federation]] (RLIF) was formed at a meeting in [[Bordeaux]].

During the second half of the 20th century, the rules changed further. In 1966, rugby league officials borrowed the American football concept of ''[[Down (football)|downs]]'': a team was allowed to retain possession of the ball for four tackles (rugby union retains the original rule that a player who is tackled and brought to the ground must release the ball immediately).  The maximum number of tackles was later increased to six (in 1971), and in rugby league this became known as the [[Playing rugby league#Six tackle rule|''six tackle rule'']].

With the advent of full-time professionals in the early 1990s, and the consequent speeding up of the game, the five metre off-side distance between the two teams became 10&nbsp;metres, and the replacement rule was superseded by various interchange rules, among other changes.

The laws of rugby union also changed during the 20th century, although less significantly than those of rugby league. In particular, goals from ''[[mark (rugby)|marks]]'' were abolished, kicks directly ''[[Touch (rugby)|into touch]]'' from outside the ''[[Rugby pitch|22 metre]]'' line were penalised, new laws were put in place to determine who had possession following an inconclusive ''[[Ruck (Rugby union)|ruck]]'' or ''[[Rugby union gameplay#Maul|maul]]'', and the lifting of players in ''[[line-out (rugby union)|line-out]]s'' was legalised.

In 1995, rugby union became an "open" game, that is one which allowed professional players.<ref>{{cite web |title=History of the RFU |url=http://www.rfu.com/AboutTheRFU/History.aspx |work=[[Rugby Football Union|RFU]] |accessdate=28 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100422210444/http://www.rfu.com/AboutTheRFU/History.aspx |archivedate=22 April 2010}}</ref> Although the original dispute between the two codes has now disappeared – and despite the fact that officials from both forms of rugby football have sometimes mentioned the possibility of re-unification – the rules of both codes and their culture have diverged to such an extent that such an event is unlikely in the foreseeable future.

== Use of the word "football" ==
{{details|Football (word)}}
The word ''football'', when used in reference to a specific game can mean any one of those described above. Because of this, much friendly controversy has occurred over the term ''football'', primarily because it is used in different ways in different parts of the [[English-speaking world]]. Most often, the word "football" is used to refer to the code of football that is considered dominant within a particular region. So, effectively, what the word "football" means usually depends on where one says it.
[[File:The Sportsman 1910-11-25 Football.png|thumb|Heading from The Sportsman (London) front page of 25 November 1910, illustrating the continued use of the word "football" to encompass both association football and rugby]]
In each of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada, one football code is known solely as "football", while the others generally require a qualifier. In New Zealand, "football" historically referred to [[rugby union]], but more recently may be used unqualified to refer to association football. The sport meant by the word "football" in Australia is either [[Australian rules football]] or [[rugby league]], depending on local popularity (which largely conforms to the [[Barassi Line]]).

'''Football''' is a family of [[team sport]]s that involve, to varying degrees, [[Kick (football)|kicking]] a [[Football (ball)|ball]] to score a [[Goal (sport)|goal]].  Unqualified, [[Football (word)|the word ''football'']] is understood to refer to whichever form of football is the most popular in the regional context in which the word appears. Sports commonly called ''football'' in certain places include [[association football]] (known as soccer in some countries); [[gridiron football]] (specifically [[American football]] or [[Canadian football]]); [[Australian rules football]]; [[rugby football]] (either [[rugby league]] or [[rugby union]]); and [[Gaelic football]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Reilly |first=Thomas |last2=Gilbourne |first2=D. |title=Science and football: a review of applied research in the football code |journal=Journal of Sports Sciences |year=2003 |volume=21 |issue=9 |pages=693–705 |doi=10.1080/0264041031000102105}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&objectid=11272089 |title=Editorial: Soccer – or should we say football – must change |date=12 June 2014 |quote=New Zealanders on the way to their local rugby grounds should still be talking of "going to the football"}}</ref> These different variations of football are known as '''football codes'''.

== Common elements ==
[[File:Men kicking footballs.webm|alt=Men kicking footballs|thumb|upright=1.25|Men kicking footballs]]
The various codes of football share certain common elements and can be grouped into two main classes of football: ''carrying'' codes like American football, Canadian football, rugby union and rugby league, where the ball is moved about the field while being held in the hands or thrown, and ''kicking'' codes such as Association football and Gaelic football, where the ball is moved primarily with the feet, and where handling is strictly limited.<ref name="Douge">{{cite book |last=Douge |first=Brian |title=Science and Football |year=2011 |publisher=Routledge |location=Abingdon |isbn=978-0-415-50911-4 |pages=3–19 |edition=Second |chapter=Football: the common threads between the games|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vCDBicFbsioC }}</ref>

Common rules among the sports include:<ref>{{Cite web |title=Law 1: The Field of Play - Football Rules & Governance {{!}} The FA|url = http://www.thefa.com/football-rules-governance/laws/football-11-11/law-1---the-field-of-play|website = www.thefa.com|accessdate = 27 September 2015|first = The Football|last = Association}}</ref>
* Two ''teams'' of usually between 11 and 18 players; some variations that have fewer players (five or more per team) are also popular.
* A clearly defined area in which to play the game.
* ''[[Score (sport)|Scoring]]'' ''[[goal (sport)|goals]]'' or ''points'' by moving the ball to an opposing team's end of the field and either into a goal area, or over a line.
* Goals or points resulting from players putting the ball between two ''[[goalposts]]''.
* The goal or line being ''defended'' by the opposing team.
* Players being required to move the ball—depending on the code—by kicking, carrying, or hand-passing the ball.
* Players using only their body to move the ball.

In all codes, common skills include [[Passing (sports)|passing]], [[Tackle (football move)|tackling]], evasion of tackles, catching and [[Kick (football)|kicking]].<ref name="Douge" /> In most codes, there are rules restricting the movement of players ''[[Offside (sport)|offside]]'', and players scoring a goal must put the ball either under or over a ''[[Goal (sport)|crossbar]]'' between the goalposts.

== Etymology ==
{{Main|Football (word)}}
There are conflicting explanations of the origin of the word "football".  It is widely assumed that the word "football" (or the phrase "foot ball") refers to the action of the foot kicking a ball.<ref>{{cite web |title=Football |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=football&allowed_in_frame=0 |publisher=Etymology Online |accessdate=14 December 2015}}</ref>  There is an alternative explanation, which is that football originally referred to a variety of games in [[medieval Europe]], which were played ''on foot''. There is no conclusive evidence for either explanation.

The [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] are known to have played many ball games, some of which involved the use of the feet. The Roman game ''[[harpastum]]'' is believed to have been adapted from a [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] team game known as "?????????"

There are a number of references to traditional, [[ancient]], or [[prehistoric]] ball games, played by [[indigenous peoples]] in many different parts of the world. For example, in 1586, men from a ship commanded by an English explorer named [[John Davis (English explorer)|John Davis]], went ashore to play a form of football with [[Inuit]] (Eskimo) people in Greenland.<ref>Richard Hakluyt, [http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/h/hakluyt/northwest/chapter8.html Voyages in Search of The North-West Passage] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012191427/http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/h/hakluyt/northwest/chapter8.html |date=12 October 2008 }}, ''[[University of Adelaide]]'', 29 December 2003</ref> There are later accounts of an Inuit game played on ice, called ''Aqsaqtuk''. Each match began with two teams facing each other in parallel lines, before attempting to kick the ball through each other team's line and then at a goal. In 1610, [[William Strachey]], a colonist at [[Jamestown, Virginia]] recorded a game played by Native Americans, called ''Pahsaheman''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} On the [[Australian continent]] several tribes of [[indigenous Australians|indigenous people]] played kicking and catching games with stuffed balls which have been generalised by historians as ''[[Marn Grook]]'' ([[Djab Wurrung]] for "game ball"). The earliest historical account is an [[anecdote]] from the 1878 book by [[Robert Brough-Smyth]], ''The Aborigines of Victoria'', in which a man called Richard Thomas is quoted as saying, in about 1841 in [[Victoria, Australia]], that he had witnessed Aboriginal people playing the game: "Mr Thomas describes how the foremost player will drop kick a ball made from the skin of a [[Phalangeriformes|possum]] and how other players leap into the air in order to catch it." Some historians have theorised that ''Marn Grook'' was one of the [[Origins of Australian football|origins of]] [[Australian rules football]].

The [[M?ori people|M?ori]] in New Zealand played a game called [[Ki-o-rahi]] consisting of teams of seven players play on a circular field divided into zones, and score points by touching the 'pou' (boundary markers) and hitting a central 'tupu' or target.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

[[Mesoamerican ballgame|Games played in Mesoamerica]] with rubber balls by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]] are also well-documented as existing since before this time, but these had more similarities to [[basketball]] or [[volleyball]], and no links have been found between such games and modern football sports. Northeastern American Indians, especially the [[Iroquois]] Confederation, played a game which made use of net racquets to throw and catch a small ball; however, although it is a ball-goal foot game, [[lacrosse]] (as its modern descendant is called) is likewise not usually classed as a form of "football."{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

These games and others may well go far back into antiquity. However, the main sources of modern football codes appear to lie in western Europe, especially England.

The early forms of football played in England, sometimes referred to as "[[mob football]]", would be played between neighbouring towns and villages, involving an unlimited number of players on opposing teams who would clash ''en masse'',<ref>{{cite book |last=Dunning |first=Eric |title=Sport Matters: Sociological Studies of Sport, Violence and Civilisation |publisher=Routledge |year=1999 |page=89 |isbn=978-0-415-09378-1}}</ref> struggling to move an item, such as inflated animal's bladder<ref name="sportmatters">{{cite book |last=Dunning |first=Eric |title=Sport Matters: Sociological Studies of Sport, Violence and Civilisation |publisher=Routledge |year=1999 |page=88 |isbn=978-0-415-09378-1}}</ref> to particular geographical points, such as their opponents' church, with play taking place in the open space between neighbouring parishes.<ref>{{cite book |last=Baker |first=William |title=Sports in the Western World |publisher=University of Illinois Press |year=1988 |page=48 |isbn=978-0-252-06042-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rkuAiv3LoR4C }}</ref> The game was played primarily during significant religious festivals, such as Shrovetide, Christmas, or Easter,<ref name="sportmatters" /> and Shrovetide games have survived into the modern era in a number of English towns (see below).

The first detailed description of what was almost certainly football in England was given by [[William FitzStephen]] in about 1174–1183. He described the activities of London youths during the annual festival of [[Shrove Tuesday]]:
{{quote|After lunch all the youth of the city go out into the fields to take part in a ball game. The students of each school have their own ball; the workers from each city craft are also carrying their balls. Older citizens, fathers, and wealthy citizens come on horseback to watch their juniors competing, and to relive their own youth vicariously: you can see their inner passions aroused as they watch the action and get caught up in the fun being had by the carefree adolescents.<ref>Stephen Alsford, [http://www.trytel.com/~tristan/towns/florilegium/introduction/intro01.html#p25 FitzStephen's Description of London], ''Florilegium Urbanum'', April 5, 2006</ref>}}

Most of the very early references to the game speak simply of "ball play" or "playing at ball". This reinforces the idea that the games played at the time did not necessarily involve a ball being kicked.

An early reference to a ball game that was probably football comes from 1280 at [[Ulgham]], Northumberland, England:  "Henry... while playing at ball.. ran against David".<ref name=Magoun>Francis Peabody Magoun, 1929, "Football in Medieval England and Middle-English literature" (''The American Historical Review'', v. 35, No. 1).</ref>  Football was played in Ireland in 1308, with a documented reference to John McCrocan, a spectator at a "football game" at [[Newcastle, County Down]] being charged with accidentally stabbing a player named William Bernard.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.carlow-nationalist.ie/tabId/392/itemId/2418/Irish-inventions-fact-and-fiction.aspx |title=Irish inventions: fact and fiction |publisher=Carlow-nationalist.ie |date= |accessdate=16 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120729154246/http://www.carlow-nationalist.ie/tabId/392/itemId/2418/Irish-inventions-fact-and-fiction.aspx |archivedate=29 July 2012 |df=}}</ref>  Another reference to a football game comes in 1321 at [[Shouldham]], Norfolk, England: "[d]uring the game at ball as he kicked the ball, a lay friend of his... ran against him and wounded himself".<ref name="Magoun"/>

In 1314, [[Nicholas de Farndone]], [[Lord Mayor of the City of London]] issued a decree banning football in the French used by the English upper classes at the time. A translation reads: "[f]orasmuch as there is great noise in the city caused by hustling over large foot balls [''rageries de grosses pelotes de pee'']<ref>Derek Birley (Sport and The Making of Britain). 1993. Manchester University Press. p. 32. 978-0719037597</ref> in the fields of the public from which many evils might arise which God forbid: we command and forbid on behalf of the king, on pain of imprisonment, such game to be used in the city in the future." This is the earliest reference to football.

In 1363, King [[Edward III of England]] issued a proclamation banning "...handball, football, or hockey; coursing and cock-fighting, or other such idle games",<ref>Derek Baker (England in the Later Middle Ages). 1995. Boydell & Brewer. p. 187. {{ISBN|978-0-85115-648-4}}</ref> showing that "football" – whatever its exact form in this case – was being differentiated from games involving other parts of the body, such as handball.

A game known as "football" was played in Scotland as early as the 15th century: it was prohibited by the Football Act 1424 and although the law fell into disuse it was not repealed until 1906. There is evidence for schoolboys playing a "football" ball game in Aberdeen in 1633 (some references cite 1636) which is notable as an early allusion to what some have considered to be passing the ball. The word "pass" in the most recent translation is derived from "huc percute" (strike it here) and later "repercute pilam" (strike the ball again) in the original Latin. It is not certain that the ball was being struck between members of the same team. The original word translated as "goal" is "metum", literally meaning the "pillar at each end of the circus course" in a Roman chariot race. There is a reference to "get hold of the ball before [another player] does" (Praeripe illi pilam si possis agere) suggesting that handling of the ball was allowed. One sentence states in the original 1930 translation "Throw yourself against him" (Age, objice te illi).
[[File:Football gravure 1750.jpg|thumb|France circa 1750]]
King [[Henry IV of England]] also presented one of the earliest documented uses of the English word "football", in 1409, when he issued a proclamation forbidding the levying of money for "foteball".<ref name=Magoun/><ref name=Etymology>{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=football |title=Online Etymology Dictionary (no date), "football" |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=19 June 2010}}</ref>

There is also an account in [[Latin]] from the end of the 15th century of football being played at [[Cawston, Nottinghamshire]]. This is the first description of a "kicking game" and the first description of [[dribbling]]: "[t]he game at which they had met for common recreation is called by some the foot-ball game. It is one in which young men, in country sport, propel a huge ball not by throwing it into the air but by striking it and rolling it along the ground, and that not with their hands but with their feet... kicking in opposite directions" The chronicler gives the earliest reference to a football pitch, stating that: "[t]he boundaries have been marked and the game had started.<ref name=Magoun/>

Other firsts in the mediæval and [[early modern Europe|early modern]] eras:

* "a football", in the sense of a ball rather than a game, was first mentioned in 1486.<ref name=Etymology/> This reference is in Dame [[Juliana Berners]]' ''Book of [[St Albans]]''. It states: "a certain rounde instrument to play with ...it is an instrument for the foote and then it is calde in Latyn 'pila pedalis', a fotebal."<ref name=Magoun/>
* a pair of football boots were ordered by King [[Henry VIII of England]] in 1526.<ref>[http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1150460,00.html Vivek Chaudhary, "Who's the fat bloke in the number eight shirt?"] (''[[The Guardian]]'', 18 February 2004.)</ref>
* women playing a form of football was first described in 1580 by Sir [[Philip Sidney]] in one of his poems: "[a] tyme there is for all, my mother often sayes, When she, with skirts tuckt very hy, with girles at football playes."<ref>Anniina Jokinen, [http://www.luminarium.org/editions/sidneydialogue.htm Sir Philip Sidney. "A Dialogue Between Two Shepherds"] (''Luminarium.org'', July 2006)</ref>
* the first references to ''goals'' are in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. In 1584 and 1602 respectively, [[John Norden]] and [[Richard Carew (antiquary)|Richard Carew]] referred to "goals" in [[Cornish hurling]]. Carew described how goals were made: "they pitch two bushes in the ground, some eight or ten foote asunder; and directly against them, ten or twelue [twelve] score off, other twayne in like distance, which they terme their Goales".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/srvcr10.txt |title=EBook of The Survey of Cornwall |last=Richard |first=Carew |publisher=Project Gutenberg |accessdate=3 October 2007}}</ref> He is also the first to describe goalkeepers and passing of the ball between players.
* the first direct reference to ''scoring a goal'' is in [[John Day (dramatist)|John Day]]'s play ''[[The Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green]]'' (performed circa 1600; published 1659): "I'll play a gole at [[Camping (game)|camp-ball]]" (an extremely violent variety of football, which was popular in [[East Anglia]]). Similarly in a poem in 1613, [[Michael Drayton]] refers to "when the Ball to throw, And drive it to the Gole, in squadrons forth they goe".

=== Calcio Fiorentino ===
[[File:Calcio fiorentino 1688.jpg|right|thumb|An illustration of the ''Calcio Fiorentino'' field and starting positions, from a 1688 book by Pietro di Lorenzo Bini.]]
{{Main|Calcio Fiorentino}}
In the 16th century, the city of [[Florence]] celebrated the period between [[Epiphany (feast)|Epiphany]] and [[Lent]] by playing a game which today is known as "''calcio storico''" ("historic kickball") in the [[Piazza Santa Croce]]. The young aristocrats of the city would dress up in fine silk costumes and embroil themselves in a violent form of football. For example, ''calcio'' players could punch, shoulder charge, and kick opponents. Blows below the belt were allowed. The game is said to have originated as a military training exercise. In 1580, Count Giovanni de' Bardi di Vernio wrote ''Discorso sopra 'l giuoco del Calcio Fiorentino''. This is sometimes said to be the earliest code of rules for any football game. The game was not played after January 1739 (until it was revived in May 1930).

{{Main|Attempts to ban football games}}
There have been many attempts to ban football, from the [[middle ages]] through to the modern day. The first such law was passed in England in 1314; it was followed by more than 30 in England alone between 1314 and 1667.<ref name="Women Football and Europe">{{cite book |isbn=9781841262253 |title=Women, Football and Europe: Histories, Equity and Experience | editor1-last = Magee | editor1-first= Jonathan |year=2007 |publisher=Meyer & Meyer Sport | editor2-last = Caudwell | editor2-first= Jayne | editor3-last = Liston | editor3-first= Kate | editor4-last = Scraton | editor4-first= Sheila |series=International Football Institute Series |volume=1 |pages=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yo2ZnpOQc7AC }}</ref>{{rp|6}} Football faced armed opposition in the 18th Century when used as a cover for violent protest against the [[enclosure act]].{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Women were banned from playing at English and Scottish Football League grounds in 1921, a ban that was only lifted in the 1970s. Female footballers still face similar problems in some parts of the world.

== Establishment of modern codes ==

=== English public schools ===
{{Main|English public school football games}}
While football continued to be played in various forms throughout Britain, its [[public school (England)|public schools]] (equivalent to private schools in other countries) are widely credited with four key achievements in the creation of modern football codes. First of all, the evidence suggests that they were important in taking football away from its "mob" form and turning it into an organised team sport. Second, many early descriptions of football and references to it were recorded by people who had studied at these schools. Third, it was teachers, students and former students from these schools who first codified football games, to enable matches to be played between schools. Finally, it was at English public schools that the division between "kicking" and "running" (or "carrying") games first became clear.

The earliest evidence that games resembling football were being played at English public schools – mainly attended by boys from the upper, upper-middle and professional classes – comes from the ''Vulgaria'' by William Herman in 1519. Herman had been headmaster at [[Eton College|Eton]] and [[Winchester College|Winchester]] colleges and his [[Latin]] textbook includes a translation exercise with the phrase "We wyll playe with a ball full of wynde".<ref>A history of Winchester College. by Arthur F Leach. Duckworth, 1899 {{ISBN|1-4446-5884-0}}</ref>

[[Richard Mulcaster]], a student at [[Eton College]] in the early 16th century and later headmaster at other English schools, has been described as "the greatest sixteenth Century advocate of football".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.footballnetwork.org/dev/historyoffootball/history8_18_3.asp |title=2003, "Richard Mulcaster" |publisher=Footballnetwork.org |date= |accessdate=19 June 2010}}</ref> Among his contributions are the earliest evidence of organised team football. Mulcaster's writings refer to teams ("sides" and "parties"), positions ("standings"), a referee ("judge over the parties") and a coach "(trayning maister)". Mulcaster's "footeball" had evolved from the disordered and violent forms of traditional football:

{{quote|[s]ome smaller number with such overlooking, sorted into sides and standings, not meeting with their bodies so boisterously to trie their strength: nor shouldring or shuffing one an other so barbarously ... may use footeball for as much good to the body, by the chiefe use of the legges.<ref>

In 1633, [[David Wedderburn (writer)|David Wedderburn]], a teacher from [[Aberdeen]], mentioned elements of modern football games in a short [[Latin]] textbook called ''Vocabula.'' Wedderburn refers to what has been translated into modern English as "keeping goal" and makes an allusion to passing the ball ("strike it here"). There is a reference to "get hold of the ball", suggesting that some handling was allowed. It is clear that the tackles allowed included the charging and holding of opposing players ("drive that man back").<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Shared Origins of Football, Rugby, and Soccer |last=Rowley |first=Christopher |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |year=2015 |isbn=9781442246195 |location= |pages=86 |via=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HmBoCgAAQBAJ }}</ref>

A more detailed description of football is given in [[Francis Willughby]]'s ''Book of Games'', written in about 1660.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P-io9DcBllkC&pg=PA168&lpg=PA168&vq=football&dq=willughby+book+of+sports |title=Francis Willughby, 1660–72, '&#39;Book of Games'&#39; |publisher= |date= |accessdate=19 June 2010 |isbn=978-1-85928-460-5 |year=2003}}</ref> Willughby, who had studied at [[Bishop Vesey's Grammar School]], [[Sutton Coldfield]], is the first to describe goals and a distinct playing field: "a close that has a gate at either end. The gates are called Goals." His book includes a diagram illustrating a football field. He also mentions tactics ("leaving some of their best players to guard the goal"); scoring ("they that can strike the ball through their opponents' goal first win") and the way teams were selected ("the players being equally divided according to their strength and nimbleness"). He is the first to describe a "law" of football: "they must not strike [an opponent's leg] higher than the ball".{{Citation needed|date=June 2009|reason=For all the quotes in this paragraph}}

English public schools were the first to codify football games. In particular, they devised the first ''[[offside (sport)|offside]]'' rules, during the late 18th century.<ref name=Carosi>[http://www.kenaston.org/download/KenAstonRefereeSociety/offside_history-JulianCarosi.pdf Julian Carosi, 2006, "The History of Offside"]</ref> In the earliest manifestations of these rules, players were "off their side" if they simply stood between the ball and the goal which was their objective. Players were not allowed to pass the ball forward, either by foot or by hand. They could only dribble with their feet, or advance the ball in a ''[[Scrum (rugby)|scrum]]'' or similar ''formation''. However, offside laws began to diverge and develop differently at each school, as is shown by the rules of football from Winchester, [[Rugby School|Rugby]], [[Harrow School|Harrow]] and [[Cheltenham School|Cheltenham]], during between 1810 and 1850.<ref name=Carosi/> The first known codes – in the sense of a set of rules – were those of Eton in 1815 <ref name="Richard William Cox 2002 243">{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of British Football |first=Richard William |last=Cox |first2=Dave |last2=Russell |first3=Wray |last3=Vamplew |publisher=Routledge |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-7146-5249-8 |page=243|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JKbb02bg6zYC }}</ref> and [[Aldenham]] in 1825.<ref name="Richard William Cox 2002 243"/>)

During the early 19th century, most working class people in Britain had to work six days a week, often for over twelve hours a day. They had neither the time nor the inclination to engage in sport for recreation and, at the time, many [[Child labour#Industrial Revolution|children were part of the labour force]]. [[Feast day]] football played on the streets was in decline. Public school boys, who enjoyed some freedom from work, became the inventors of organised football games with formal codes of rules.

Football was adopted by a number of public schools as a way of encouraging competitiveness and keeping youths fit. Each school drafted its own rules, which varied widely between different schools and were changed over time with each new intake of pupils. Two schools of thought developed regarding rules. Some schools favoured a game in which the ball could be carried (as at Rugby, [[Marlborough College|Marlborough]] and Cheltenham), while others preferred a game where kicking and dribbling the ball was promoted (as at Eton, Harrow, [[Westminster School|Westminster]] and [[Charterhouse School|Charterhouse]]). The division into these two camps was partly the result of circumstances in which the games were played. For example, Charterhouse and Westminster at the time had restricted playing areas; the boys were confined to playing their ball game within the school [[cloisters]], making it difficult for them to adopt rough and tumble running games.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009|reason=For the whole paragraph}}

[[File:Rugby School 850.jpg|thumb|left|[[Rugby School]] ]] [[William Webb Ellis]], a pupil at Rugby School, is said to have "with a fine disregard for the rules of football, ''as played in his time'' [emphasis added], first took the ball in his arms and ran with it, thus creating the distinctive feature of the rugby game." in 1823. This act is usually said to be the beginning of Rugby football, but there is little evidence that it occurred, and most sports historians believe the story to be apocryphal. The act of 'taking the ball in his arms' is often misinterpreted as 'picking the ball up' as it is widely believed that Webb Ellis' 'crime' was handling the ball, as in modern soccer, however handling the ball at the time was often permitted and in some cases compulsory,<ref>example of ball handling in early football from English writer [[William Hone]], writing in 1825 or 1826, quotes the social commentator Sir [[Frederick Morton Eden]], regarding "Foot-Ball", as played at [[Scone, Scotland|]], Scotland:
:''The game was this: he who at any time got the ball into his hands, run [sic] with it till overtaken by one of the opposite part; and then, if he could shake himself loose from those on the opposite side who seized him, he run on; if not, he threw the ball from him, unless it was wrested from him by the other party'', but no person was allowed to kick it. ([http://www.uab.edu/english/hone/etexts/edb/day-pages/046-february15.html William Hone, 1825–26, ''The Every-Day Book'', "February 15."] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080105043230/http://www.uab.edu/english/hone/etexts/edb/day-pages/046-february15.html |date=5 January 2008 }} Access date: 15 March 2007.)</ref> the rule for which Webb Ellis showed disregard was ''running forward with it'' as the rules of his time only allowed a player to retreat backwards or kick forwards.

[[Railway Mania|The boom in rail transport in Britain]] during the 1840s meant that people were able to travel further and with less inconvenience than they ever had before. Inter-school sporting competitions became possible. However, it was difficult for schools to play each other at football, as each school played by its own rules. The solution to this problem was usually that the match be divided into two halves, one half played by the rules of the host "home" school, and the other half by the visiting "away" school.

The ''modern'' rules of many football codes were formulated during the mid- or late- 19th century. This also applies to other sports such as lawn bowls, lawn tennis, etc. The major impetus for this was the patenting of the world's first [[lawnmower]] in 1830. This allowed for the preparation of modern ovals, playing fields, pitches, grass courts, etc.<ref>ABC Radio National ''Ockham's Razor'', first broadcast 6 June 2010.</ref>

Apart from Rugby football, the public school codes have barely been played beyond the confines of each school's playing fields. However, many of them are still played at the schools which created them (see [[Football#Surviving UK school games|Surviving UK school games]] below).

Public schools' dominance of sports in the UK began to wane after the [[Factory Act 1850|''Factory Act'' of 1850]], which significantly increased the recreation time available to working class children. Before 1850, many British children had to work six days a week, for more than twelve hours a day. From 1850, they could not work before 6&nbsp;a.m. (7&nbsp;a.m. in winter) or after 6&nbsp;p.m. on weekdays (7&nbsp;p.m. in winter); on Saturdays they had to cease work at 2&nbsp;p.m. These changes meant that working class children had more time for games, including various forms of football.

==== Clubs ====
{{Main|Oldest football clubs}}

Sports clubs dedicated to playing football began in the 18th century, for example [[The Gymnastic Society|London's Gymnastic Society]] which was founded in the mid-18th century and ceased playing matches in 1796.<ref>THE SURREY CLUB Bell's Life in London and Sporting Chronicle (London, England), Sunday, 7 October 1849; pg. 6. New Readerships</ref><ref>Football: The First Hundred Years. The Untold Story. Adrian Harvey. 2005. Routledge, London</ref>

The first documented club to bear in the title a reference to being a 'football club' were called "The Foot-Ball Club" who were located in [[Edinburgh]], Scotland, during the period 1824–41.<ref>John Hope, ''Accounts and papers of the football club kept by John Hope, WS, and some Hope Correspondence 1787–1886'' (National Archives of Scotland, GD253/183)</ref><ref name="Nas.gov.uk">{{cite web |url=http://www.nas.gov.uk/about/071112.asp |title=The Foot-Ball Club in Edinburgh, 1824–1841 – The National Archives of Scotland |publisher=Nas.gov.uk |date=13 November 2007 |accessdate=19 June 2010}}</ref>  The club forbade tripping but allowed pushing and holding and the picking up of the ball.<ref name="Nas.gov.uk"/>

In 1845, three boys at Rugby school were tasked with codifying the rules then being used at the school. These were the first set of written rules (or code) for any form of football.<ref>{{cite web |title=Rugby chronology |work=Museum of Rugby |url=http://www.rfu.com/microsites/museum/page.aspx?section=89&sectionTitle=World+Rugby+Chronology |accessdate=24 April 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121094425/http://www.rfu.com/microsites/museum/page.aspx?section=89&sectionTitle=World%2BRugby%2BChronology |archivedate=21 November 2008 |df=}}</ref> This further assisted the spread of the Rugby game.

==== Competitions ====
{{Main|Oldest football competitions}}

One of the longest running football fixture is the [[Cordner-Eggleston Cup]], contested between [[Melbourne Grammar School]] and [[Scotch College, Melbourne]] every year since 1858. It is believed by many to also be the first match of [[Australian rules football]], although it was played under experimental rules in its first year. The first football trophy tournament was the Caledonian Challenge Cup, donated by the Royal [[Caledonians|Caledonian]] Society of Melbourne, played in 1861 under the [[Melbourne Rules]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.electricscotland.com/history/australia/melbourne.htm |title=History of the Royal Caledonian Society of Melbourne |publisher=Electricscotland.com |date= |accessdate=19 June 2010}}</ref>  The oldest football league is a rugby football competition, the [[United Hospitals Challenge Cup]] (1874), while the oldest rugby trophy is the [[Yorkshire Cup (rugby union)|Yorkshire Cup]], contested since 1878. The [[South Australian Football Association]] (30 April 1877) is the oldest surviving Australian rules football competition. The oldest surviving soccer trophy is the [[Youdan Cup]] (1867) and the oldest national football competition is the English FA Cup (1871).   [[The Football League]] (1888) is recognised as the longest running Association Football league. The [[England v Scotland (1870)|first ''ever'' international football match]] took place between sides representing England and Scotland on 5 March 1870 at [[the Oval]] under the authority of the FA. The first Rugby international took place in 1871.

==== Modern balls ====
{{Main|Football (ball)}}

[[File:Richard Lindon (1816-1887).jpg|upright|thumb|[[Richard Lindon]] (seen in 1880) is believed to have invented the first footballs with rubber bladders.]] In Europe, early footballs were made out of animal [[urinary bladder|bladders]], more specifically [[Pig bladder|pig's bladders]], which were inflated. Later leather coverings were introduced to allow the balls to keep their shape.<ref>[http://www.soccerballworld.com/History.htm#Early Soccer Ball World – Early History].

Richard Lindon's wife is said to have died of lung disease caused by blowing up pig's bladders.<ref>The exact name of Mr Lindon is in dispute, as well as the exact timing of the creation of the inflatable bladder. It is known that he created this for both association and rugby footballs. However, sites devoted to football indicate he was known as [https://web.archive.org/web/20070311213720/http://www.richardlindon.com/ HJ Lindon], who was actually Richard Lindon's son, and created the ball in 1862 (ref: [http://www.soccerballworld.com/History.htm Soccer Ball World]), whereas rugby sites refer to him as [[Richard Lindon]] creating the ball in 1870 (ref: [http://observer.guardian.co.uk/osm/story/0,,1699545,00.html Guardian article]). Both agree that his wife died when inflating pig's bladders. This information originated from web sites which may be unreliable, and the answer may only be found in researching books in central libraries.</ref> Lindon also won medals for the invention of the "Rubber inflatable Bladder" and the "Brass Hand Pump".

In 1855, the U.S. inventor [[Charles Goodyear]] – who had patented [[vulcanized rubber|vulcanised rubber]] – exhibited a spherical football, with an exterior of vulcanised rubber panels, at the [[Exposition Universelle (1855)|Paris ''Exhibition Universelle'']]. The ball was to prove popular in early forms of football in the U.S.A.<ref>[http://www.soccerballworld.com/Oldestball.htm soccerballworld.com, (no date) "Charles Goodyear's Soccer Ball"] Downloaded 30/11/06.</ref>

The iconic ball with a regular pattern of hexagons and pentagons (see [[truncated icosahedron]]) did not become popular until the 1960s, and was first used in the World Cup [[1970 FIFA World Cup|in 1970]].

==== Modern ball passing tactics ====
{{Main|Passing (association football)}}

The earliest reference to a game of football involving players passing the ball and attempting to score past a goalkeeper was written in 1633 by David Wedderburn, a poet and teacher in [[Aberdeen]], Scotland.<ref>[http://www.scotsman.com/news/scottish-news/edinburgh-east-fife/scots_invented_beautiful_game_1_1121849 Scots invented beautiful game] The Scotsman, 14 June 2006</ref>  Nevertheless, the original text does not state whether the allusion to passing as 'kick the ball back' ('Repercute pilam') was in a forward or backward direction or between members of the same opposing teams (as was usual at this time)<ref>Magoun, Francis Peabody (1938).

=== Cambridge rules ===
{{Main|Cambridge rules}}
In 1848, at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]], [[H. de Winton]] and [[J. C. Thring]], who were both formerly at [[Shrewsbury School]], called a meeting at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], with 12 other representatives from Eton, Harrow, Rugby, [[Winchester College|Winchester]] and Shrewsbury. An eight-hour meeting produced what amounted to the first set of modern rules, known as the ''Cambridge rules''. No copy of these rules now exists, but a revised version from circa 1856 is held in the library of Shrewsbury School.<ref>
{{cite web |title=Football Association tribute to the Cambridge Rules |url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/news/football-association-tribute-to-the-cambridge-rules |accessdate=5 January 2015}}
</ref> The rules clearly favour the kicking game. Handling was only allowed ''when a player catches the ball directly from the foot'' entitling them to a free kick and there was a primitive offside rule, disallowing players from "loitering" around the opponents' goal. The Cambridge rules were not widely adopted outside English public schools and universities (but it was arguably the most significant influence on [[the Football Association]] committee members responsible for formulating the rules of Association football).

=== Sheffield rules ===
{{Main|Sheffield rules}}
By the late 1850s, many football clubs had been formed throughout the English-speaking world, to play various codes of football. [[Sheffield F.C.|Sheffield Football Club]], founded in 1857 in the English city of [[Sheffield]] by Nathaniel Creswick and William Prest, was later recognised as the world's oldest club playing association football.<ref name="Football, the First Hundred Years">{{cite book |first=Adrian |last=Harvey |title=Football, the First Hundred Years |year=2005 |pages=95–99 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-35019-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TxoZ0S-GC7MC}}</ref>
However, the club initially played its own code of football: the ''Sheffield rules''. The code was largely independent of the public school rules, the most significant difference being the lack of an ''offside'' rule.

The code was responsible for many innovations that later spread to association football. These included [[wikt:free kick|free kick]]s, [[corner kick]]s, handball, [[throw-in]]s and the crossbar.<ref>{{cite book |first=Brendan |last=Murphy |title=From Sheffield with Love |year=2007 |pages=41–43 |publisher=Sports Book Limited |isbn=978-1-899807-56-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D9PVkQEACAAJ }}</ref> By the 1870s they became the dominant code in the north and midlands of England. At this time a series of rule changes by both the [[The Football Association|London]] and [[Sheffield and Hallamshire County Football Association|Sheffield]] FAs gradually eroded the differences between the two games until the adoption of a common code in 1877.

=== Australian rules ===

{{See also|Origins of Australian rules football}}
[[File:Tom Wills 1857.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Tom Wills]], widely regarded as the father of Australian football]]
There is archival evidence of "foot-ball" games being played in various parts of Australia throughout the first half of the 19th century. The origins of an organised game of football known today as Australian rules football can be traced back to 1858 in [[Melbourne]], the capital city of [[Victoria (state)|Victoria]].

In July 1858, [[Tom Wills]], an Australian-born cricketer educated at [[Rugby School]] in England, wrote a letter to ''[[Bell's Life in Victoria|Bell's Life in Victoria & Sporting Chronicle]]'', calling for a "foot-ball club" with a "code of laws" to keep cricketers fit during winter.<ref>{{cite web |title=Letter from Tom Wills |work=MCG website |url=http://www.mcg.org.au/default.asp?pg=footballdisplay&articleid=37 |accessdate=14 July 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060625081726/http://www.mcg.org.au/default.asp?pg=footballdisplay&articleid=37 |archivedate=25 June 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=}}</ref> This is considered by historians to be a defining moment in the creation of Australian rules football.

One week later, Wills umpired a schoolboys match between [[Melbourne Grammar School]] and [[Scotch College (Melbourne)|Scotch College]]. Following these matches, organised football in Melbourne rapidly increased in popularity.

[[File:Australianfootball1866.jpg|thumb|Wood engraving of an Australian rules football match at the [[Yarra Park|Richmond Paddock]], [[Melbourne]], 1866]]
Wills and others involved in these early matches formed the [[Melbourne Football Club]] (the oldest surviving Australian football club) on 14 May 1859. Club members Wills, [[William Hammersley]], [[J. B. Thompson]] and [[Thomas H. Smith]] met with the intention of forming a set of rules that would be widely adopted by other clubs. The committee debated rules used in English public school games; Wills pushed for various [[rugby football]] rules he learnt during his schooling. The first rules share similarities with these games, and were shaped to suit to Australian conditions. [[H. C. A. Harrison]], a seminal figure in Australian football, recalled that his cousin Wills wanted "a game of our own".<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Hibbins |first1=Gillian |last2=Mancini |first2=Anne |title=Running with the Ball: Football's Foster Father |publisher=Lynedoch Publications |year=1987 |pages=118–119 |isbn=978-0-7316-0481-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oR3wAAAAMAAJ }}</ref> The code was distinctive in the prevalence of the [[Mark (Australian football)|mark]], [[Free kick (Australian rules football)|free kick]], [[Tackle (football move)#Australian rules football|tackling]], lack of an offside rule and that players were specifically penalised for [[Handball (Australian rules football)|throwing the ball]].

The Melbourne football rules were widely distributed and gradually adopted by the other Victorian clubs. The rules were updated several times during the 1860s to accommodate the rules of other influential Victorian football clubs. A significant redraft in 1866 by H. C. A. Harrison's committee accommodated the [[Geelong Football Club]]'s rules, making the game then known as "Victorian Rules" increasingly distinct from other codes. It soon adopted cricket fields and an oval ball, used specialised goal and behind posts, and featured [[running bounce|bouncing the ball while running]] and [[specky|spectacular high marking]]. The game spread quickly to other [[Australian states and territories|Australian colonies]]. Outside its heartland in southern Australia, the code experienced a significant period of decline following World War I but has since grown throughout Australia and in [[Australian football around the world|other parts of the world]], and the [[Australian Football League]] emerged as the dominant professional competition.

During the early 1860s, there were increasing attempts in England to unify and reconcile the various public school games. In 1862, J. C. Thring, who had been one of the driving forces behind the original Cambridge Rules, was a master at [[Uppingham School]] and he issued his own rules of what he called "The Simplest Game" (these are also known as the Uppingham Rules). In early October 1863 another new revised version of the Cambridge Rules was drawn up by a seven member committee representing former pupils from Harrow, Shrewsbury, Eton, Rugby, Marlborough and Westminster.

At the [[Freemasons' Tavern]], Great Queen Street, London on the evening of 26 October 1863, representatives of several football clubs in the [[County of London|London Metropolitan area]] met for the inaugural meeting of [[The Football Association]] (FA). The aim of the Association was to establish a single unifying code and regulate the playing of the game among its members. Following the first meeting, the public schools were invited to join the association. All of them declined, except Charterhouse and Uppingham. In total, six meetings of the FA were held between October and December 1863. After the third meeting, a draft set of rules were published. However, at the beginning of the fourth meeting, attention was drawn to the recently published Cambridge Rules of 1863. The Cambridge rules differed from the draft FA rules in two significant areas; namely running with (carrying) the ball and [[hacking (rugby)|hacking]] (kicking opposing players in the shins). The two contentious FA rules were as follows:

{{quote|IX. A player shall be entitled to run with the ball towards his adversaries' goal if he makes a fair catch, or catches the ball on the first bound; but in case of a fair catch, if he makes his mark he shall not run.<br /><!--Leave it here: two rules, two lines. -->
X. If any player shall run with the ball towards his adversaries' goal, any player on the opposite side shall be at liberty to charge, hold, trip or hack him, or to wrest the ball from him, but no player shall be held and hacked at the same time.<ref>Peter Shortell. [http://clubs.rfu.com/Clubs/portals/cornwallreferees/ThoughtsforRefs6667.aspx  Hacking – a history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080403122555/http://clubs.rfu.com/Clubs/portals/cornwallreferees/ThoughtsforRefs6667.aspx |date=2008-04-03 }}, [http://clubs.rfu.com/Clubs/portals/cornwallreferees/CRRSHistory6515.aspx Cornwall Referees Society]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080303044805/http://clubs.rfu.com/Clubs/portals/cornwallreferees/CRRSHistory6515.aspx |date=3 March 2008 }}, 2 October 2006</ref>}}

At the fifth meeting it was proposed that these two rules be removed. Most of the delegates supported this, but [[F. M. Campbell]], the representative from [[Blackheath Rugby Club|Blackheath]] and the first FA treasurer, objected. He said: "hacking is the true football". However, the motion to ban running with the ball in hand and hacking was carried and Blackheath withdrew from the FA. After the final meeting on 8 December, the FA published the "[[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of Football]]", the first comprehensive set of rules for the game later known as Association Football. The term "soccer", in use since the late 19th century, derives from an [[Oxford "-er"|Oxford University abbreviation]] of "Association".<ref name=OEDsoccer>{{cite journal |date=June 2011 |title=soccer, n |journal=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |volume= |issue= |pages= |url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/183733 |accessdate=1 July 2011}}</ref>

The first FA rules still contained elements that are no longer part of association football, but which are still recognisable in other games (such as Australian football and rugby football): for instance, a player could make a fair catch and claim a ''[[Mark (Australian football)|mark]]'', which entitled him to a free kick; and if a player touched the ball behind the opponents' goal line, his side was entitled to a ''free kick'' at goal, from 15&nbsp;yards (13.5&nbsp;metres) in front of the goal line.

=== Rugby football ===
{{Main|History of rugby union}}
[[File:Football London Ilustrated News.gif|thumb|A rugby scrum in 1871]]
In [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], by 1870, there were about 75 clubs playing variations of the Rugby school game. There were also "rugby" clubs in Ireland, Australia, Canada and New Zealand. However, there was no generally accepted set of rules for rugby until 1871, when 21 clubs from London came together to form the [[Rugby Football Union]] (RFU). The first official RFU rules were adopted in June 1871. These rules allowed passing the ball. They also included the [[try]], where touching the ball over the line allowed an attempt at goal, though drop-goals from marks and general play, and penalty conversions were still the main form of contest.

=== North American football codes ===
{{Main|History of American football|Canadian football#History}}

As was the case in Britain, by the early 19th century, North American schools and universities played their own local games, between sides made up of students. For example, students at [[Dartmouth College]] in [[New Hampshire]] played a game called [[Old division football]], a variant of the association football codes, as early as the 1820s.<ref name=ODF>{{cite web |last=Meacham |first=Scott |title=Old Division Football, The Indigenous Mob Soccer Of Dartmouth College (pdf) |publisher=dartmo.com |year=2006 |url=http://www.dartmo.com/football/Football_Meacham.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=16 May 2007}}</ref> They remained largely "[[mob football]]" style games, with huge numbers of players attempting to advance the ball into a goal area, often by any means necessary. Rules were simple, violence and injury were common.<ref name=PFRA1>{{cite web |title=No Christian End! |work=The Journey to Camp: The Origins of American Football to 1889 |publisher=Professional Football Researchers Association |url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Articles/No_Christian_End.pdf |accessdate=26 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611173624/https://www.profootballresearchers.org/Articles/No_Christian_End.pdf |archivedate=11 June 2014 |df=}}</ref> The violence of these mob-style games led to widespread protests and a decision to abandon them. [[Yale University]], under pressure from the city of [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], banned the play of all forms of football in 1860, while [[Harvard University]] followed suit in 1861.<ref name=PFRA1/> In its place, two general types of football evolved: "kicking" games and "running" (or "carrying") games. A hybrid of the two, known as the "[[Boston Game|Boston game]]", was played by a group known as the [[Oneida Football Club]]. The club, considered by some historians as the first formal [[football club]] in the United States, was formed in 1862 by schoolboys who played the "Boston game" on [[Boston Common]].<ref name=PFRA1/><ref>{{cite web |last=Allaway |first=Roger |title=Were the Oneidas playing soccer or not? |work=The USA Soccer History Archives |publisher=Dave Litterer |year=2001 |url=http://www.sover.net/~spectrum/oneidas.html |accessdate=15 May 2007}}</ref> The game began to return to American college campuses by the late 1860s. The universities of Yale, [[Princeton University|Princeton]] (then known as the College of New Jersey), [[Rutgers University|Rutgers]], and [[Brown University|Brown]] all began playing "kicking" games during this time. In 1867, Princeton used rules based on those of the English [[The Football Association|Football Association]].<ref name=PFRA1/>

In Canada, the first documented football match was a practice game played on 9 November 1861, at [[University College, University of Toronto]] (approximately 400 yards west of Queen's Park). One of the participants in the game involving University of Toronto students was (Sir) William Mulock, later Chancellor of the school.<ref name=1860s>{{cite web |url=https://www.cfl.ca/page/his_timeline_1860 |work=Official Site of the Canadian Football League |title=Timeline 1860s |publisher=Canadian Football League |accessdate=13 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100501160230/http://www.cfl.ca/page/his_timeline_1860 |archivedate=1 May 2010 |df=}}</ref>  In 1864, at [[University of Trinity College|Trinity College]], Toronto, F.

On 6 November 1869, Rutgers faced Princeton in a game that was played with a round ball and, like all early games, used improvised rules. It is usually regarded as [[1869 New Jersey vs. Rutgers football game|the first game of American intercollegiate football]].<ref name=PFRA1/><ref>{{cite web |title=1800s |work=Rutgers Through The Years |publisher=Rutgers University |url=http://ruweb.rutgers.edu/timeline/1800.htm |accessdate=16 May 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070120202924/http://ruweb.rutgers.edu/timeline/1800.htm |archivedate=20 January 2007 |df=}}</ref>

Modern North American football grew out of a match between [[McGill University]] of Montreal and Harvard University in 1874. During the game, the two teams alternated between the rugby-based rules used by McGill and the Boston Game rules used by Harvard.<ref>{{cite web |title=No Christian End!

[[File:1882RutgersFootballTeam.jpg|thumb|left|Rutgers College Football Team, 1882]]
In 1880, Yale coach [[Walter Camp]], who had become a fixture at the Massasoit House conventions where the rules were debated and changed, devised a number of major innovations. Camp's two most important rule changes that diverged the American game from rugby were replacing the [[Scrum (rugby)|scrummage]] with the ''[[line of scrimmage]]'' and the establishment of the ''[[Down (American and Canadian football)|down-and-distance]]'' rules.<ref name=PFRA2/> American football still however remained a violent sport where collisions often led to serious injuries and sometimes even death.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bennett |first=Tom |title=The Pro Style: The Complete Guide to Understanding National Football League Strategy |publisher=National Football League Properties, Inc., Creative Services Division |location=Los Angeles |year=1976 |page=20}}</ref> This led U.S. President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] to hold a meeting with football representatives from Harvard, Yale, and Princeton on 9 October 1905, urging them to make drastic changes.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Tiny Maxwell and the Crisis of 1905: The Making of a Gridiron Myth |journal=College Football Historical Society |volume= |issue= |year=2001 |pages=54–57 |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/NASSH_Proceedings/NP2001/NP2001zn.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100808041801/http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/NASSH_Proceedings/NP2001/NP2001zn.pdf |deadurl=yes |archive-date=8 August 2010 |authors=Watterson, John}}</ref> One rule change introduced in 1906, devised to open up the game and reduce injury, was the introduction of the legal [[forward pass]].

Over the years, Canada absorbed some of the developments in American football in an effort to distinguish it from a more rugby-oriented game. In 1903, the [[Ontario Rugby Football Union]] adopted the [[Burnside rules]], which implemented the ''line of scrimmage'' and ''down-and-distance'' system from American football, among others.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://greycup.cfl.ca/page/grey-cup-history-timeline-1900 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=18 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120922201718/http://greycup.cfl.ca/page/grey-cup-history-timeline-1900 |archivedate=22 September 2012 |df=}} History of the Grey Cup</ref> Canadian football then implemented the legal forward pass in 1929.<ref>[https://www.cfl.ca/page/his_timeline_1920 CFL.ca History, Timeline, 1920] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100625000000/http://www.cfl.ca/page/his_timeline_1920 |date=25 June 2010 }}</ref> American and Canadian football [[Comparison of American and Canadian football|remain different codes]], stemming from rule changes that the American side of the border adopted but the Canadian side has not.

=== Gaelic football ===
[[File:Croke Park from the hill.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|All-Ireland Football Final]] in [[Croke Park]], 2004.]]
{{Main|Gaelic football#History|l1=History of Gaelic football}}
In the mid-19th century, various traditional football games, referred to collectively as ''[[caid (sport)|caid]]'', remained popular in Ireland, especially in [[County Kerry]]. One observer, Father W. Ferris, described two main forms of ''caid'' during this period: the "field game" in which the object was to put the ball through arch-like goals, formed from the boughs of two trees; and the epic "cross-country game" which took up most of the daylight hours of a Sunday on which it was played, and was won by one team taking the ball across a parish boundary. "Wrestling", "holding" opposing players, and carrying the ball were all allowed.

By the 1870s, Rugby and Association football had started to become popular in Ireland. [[Trinity College, Dublin]] was an early stronghold of Rugby (see the [[Football#Other developments in the 1850s|Developments in the 1850s]] section, above). The rules of the English FA were being distributed widely. Traditional forms of ''caid'' had begun to give way to a "rough-and-tumble game" which allowed tripping.

There was no serious attempt to unify and codify Irish varieties of football, until the establishment of the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] (GAA) in 1884. The GAA sought to promote traditional Irish sports, such as [[hurling]] and to reject imported games like Rugby and Association football. The first Gaelic football rules were drawn up by [[Maurice Davin]] and published in the ''United Ireland'' magazine on 7 February 1887. Davin's rules showed the influence of games such as hurling and a desire to formalise a distinctly Irish code of football. The prime example of this differentiation was the lack of an offside rule (an attribute which, for many years, was shared only by other Irish games like hurling, and by Australian rules football).

===  Schism in Rugby football ===
[[File:Reverend marshall.jpg|thumb|An English cartoon from the 1890s lampooning the divide in rugby football which led to the formation of [[rugby league]]. The caricatures are of Rev. Frank Marshall, an arch-opponent of player payments, and James Miller, a long-time opponent of Marshall. The caption reads:

Marshall: "Oh, fie, go away naughty boy, I don't play with boys who can’t afford to take a holiday for football any day they like!"

Miller: "Yes, that's just you to a T; you’d make it so that no lad whose father wasn’t a millionaire could play at all in a really good team. For my part I see no reason why the men who make the money shouldn’t have a share in the spending of it."]]
{{Further|History of rugby league}}
The [[International Rugby Board|International Rugby Football Board]] (IRFB) was founded in 1886, but rifts were beginning to emerge in the code. [[professional sports|Professionalism]] had already begun to creep into the various codes of football.

In England, by the 1890s, a long-standing [[Rugby Football Union]] ban on ''professional'' players was causing regional tensions within rugby football, as many players in northern England were working class and could not afford to take time off to train, travel, play and recover from injuries. This was not very different from what had occurred ten years earlier in soccer in Northern England but the authorities reacted very differently in the RFU, attempting to alienate the working class support in Northern England. In 1895, following a dispute about a player being paid broken time payments, which replaced wages lost as a result of playing rugby, representatives of the northern clubs met in [[Huddersfield]] to form the [[Rugby Football League|Northern Rugby Football Union]] (NRFU). The new body initially permitted only various types of player wage replacements. However, within two years, NRFU players could be paid, but they were required to have a job outside sport.

The demands of a professional league dictated that rugby had to become a better "spectator" sport. Within a few years the NRFU rules had started to diverge from the RFU, most notably with the abolition of the ''[[line-out (rugby union)|line-out]]''. This was followed by the replacement of the ''[[Playing rugby union#Ruck|ruck]]'' with the "play-the-ball ruck", which allowed a two-player ruck contest between the tackler at marker and the player tackled. ''[[Rugby union gameplay#Maul|Mauls]]'' were stopped once the ball carrier was held, being replaced by a play-the ball-ruck. The separate Lancashire and Yorkshire competitions of the NRFU merged in 1901, forming the ''Northern Rugby League'', the first time the name [[rugby league]] was used officially in England.

Over time, the RFU form of rugby, played by clubs which remained members of national federations affiliated to the IRFB, became known as [[rugby union]].

=== Globalisation of association football ===
{{Main|History of FIFA}}
The need for a single body to oversee association football had become apparent by the beginning of the 20th century, with the increasing popularity of international fixtures. The English Football Association had chaired many discussions on setting up an international body, but was perceived as making no progress. It fell to associations from seven other European countries: France, Belgium, Denmark, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland, to form an international association. The ''Fédération Internationale de Football Association'' ([[FIFA]]) was founded in Paris on 21 May 1904. Its first president was [[Robert Guérin]]. The French name and acronym has remained, even outside French-speaking countries.

=== Further divergence of the two rugby codes ===
Rugby league rules diverged significantly from rugby union in 1906, with the reduction of the team from 15 to 13 players. In 1907, a New Zealand professional rugby team toured Australia and Britain, receiving an enthusiastic response, and professional [[rugby league in Australia|rugby leagues were launched in Australia]] the following year. However, the rules of professional games varied from one country to another, and negotiations between various national bodies were required to fix the exact rules for each international match. This situation endured until 1948, when at the instigation of the French league, the [[Rugby League International Federation]] (RLIF) was formed at a meeting in [[Bordeaux]].

During the second half of the 20th century, the rules changed further. In 1966, rugby league officials borrowed the American football concept of ''[[Down (football)|downs]]'': a team was allowed to retain possession of the ball for four tackles (rugby union retains the original rule that a player who is tackled and brought to the ground must release the ball immediately).  The maximum number of tackles was later increased to six (in 1971), and in rugby league this became known as the [[Playing rugby league#Six tackle rule|''six tackle rule'']].

With the advent of full-time professionals in the early 1990s, and the consequent speeding up of the game, the five metre off-side distance between the two teams became 10&nbsp;metres, and the replacement rule was superseded by various interchange rules, among other changes.

The laws of rugby union also changed during the 20th century, although less significantly than those of rugby league. In particular, goals from ''[[mark (rugby)|marks]]'' were abolished, kicks directly ''[[Touch (rugby)|into touch]]'' from outside the ''[[Rugby pitch|22 metre]]'' line were penalised, new laws were put in place to determine who had possession following an inconclusive ''[[Ruck (Rugby union)|ruck]]'' or ''[[Rugby union gameplay#Maul|maul]]'', and the lifting of players in ''[[line-out (rugby union)|line-out]]s'' was legalised.

In 1995, rugby union became an "open" game, that is one which allowed professional players.<ref>{{cite web |title=History of the RFU |url=http://www.rfu.com/AboutTheRFU/History.aspx |work=[[Rugby Football Union|RFU]] |accessdate=28 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100422210444/http://www.rfu.com/AboutTheRFU/History.aspx |archivedate=22 April 2010}}</ref> Although the original dispute between the two codes has now disappeared – and despite the fact that officials from both forms of rugby football have sometimes mentioned the possibility of re-unification – the rules of both codes and their culture have diverged to such an extent that such an event is unlikely in the foreseeable future.

== Use of the word "football" ==
{{details|Football (word)}}
The word ''football'', when used in reference to a specific game can mean any one of those described above. Because of this, much friendly controversy has occurred over the term ''football'', primarily because it is used in different ways in different parts of the [[English-speaking world]]. Most often, the word "football" is used to refer to the code of football that is considered dominant within a particular region. So, effectively, what the word "football" means usually depends on where one says it.
[[File:The Sportsman 1910-11-25 Football.png|thumb|Heading from The Sportsman (London) front page of 25 November 1910, illustrating the continued use of the word "football" to encompass both association football and rugby]]
In each of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada, one football code is known solely as "football", while the others generally require a qualifier. In New Zealand, "football" historically referred to [[rugby union]], but more recently may be used unqualified to refer to association football. The sport meant by the word "football" in Australia is either [[Australian rules football]] or [[rugby league]], depending on local popularity (which largely conforms to the [[Barassi Line]]).

'''Football''' is a family of [[team sport]]s that involve, to varying degrees, [[Kick (football)|kicking]] a [[Football (ball)|ball]] to score a [[Goal (sport)|goal]].  Unqualified, [[Football (word)|the word ''football'']] is understood to refer to whichever form of football is the most popular in the regional context in which the word appears. Sports commonly called ''football'' in certain places include [[association football]] (known as soccer in some countries); [[gridiron football]] (specifically [[American football]] or [[Canadian football]]); [[Australian rules football]]; [[rugby football]] (either [[rugby league]] or [[rugby union]]); and [[Gaelic football]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Reilly |first=Thomas |last2=Gilbourne |first2=D. |title=Science and football: a review of applied research in the football code |journal=Journal of Sports Sciences |year=2003 |volume=21 |issue=9 |pages=693–705 |doi=10.1080/0264041031000102105}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&objectid=11272089 |title=Editorial: Soccer – or should we say football – must change |date=12 June 2014 |quote=New Zealanders on the way to their local rugby grounds should still be talking of "going to the football"}}</ref> These different variations of football are known as '''football codes'''.

== Common elements ==
[[File:Men kicking footballs.webm|alt=Men kicking footballs|thumb|upright=1.25|Men kicking footballs]]
The various codes of football share certain common elements and can be grouped into two main classes of football: ''carrying'' codes like American football, Canadian football, rugby union and rugby league, where the ball is moved about the field while being held in the hands or thrown, and ''kicking'' codes such as Association football and Gaelic football, where the ball is moved primarily with the feet, and where handling is strictly limited.<ref name="Douge">{{cite book |last=Douge |first=Brian |title=Science and Football |year=2011 |publisher=Routledge |location=Abingdon |isbn=978-0-415-50911-4 |pages=3–19 |edition=Second |chapter=Football: the common threads between the games|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vCDBicFbsioC }}</ref>

Common rules among the sports include:<ref>{{Cite web |title=Law 1: The Field of Play - Football Rules & Governance {{!}} The FA|url = http://www.thefa.com/football-rules-governance/laws/football-11-11/law-1---the-field-of-play|website = www.thefa.com|accessdate = 27 September 2015|first = The Football|last = Association}}</ref>
* Two ''teams'' of usually between 11 and 18 players; some variations that have fewer players (five or more per team) are also popular.
* A clearly defined area in which to play the game.
* ''[[Score (sport)|Scoring]]'' ''[[goal (sport)|goals]]'' or ''points'' by moving the ball to an opposing team's end of the field and either into a goal area, or over a line.
* Goals or points resulting from players putting the ball between two ''[[goalposts]]''.
* The goal or line being ''defended'' by the opposing team.
* Players being required to move the ball—depending on the code—by kicking, carrying, or hand-passing the ball.
* Players using only their body to move the ball.

In all codes, common skills include [[Passing (sports)|passing]], [[Tackle (football move)|tackling]], evasion of tackles, catching and [[Kick (football)|kicking]].<ref name="Douge" /> In most codes, there are rules restricting the movement of players ''[[Offside (sport)|offside]]'', and players scoring a goal must put the ball either under or over a ''[[Goal (sport)|crossbar]]'' between the goalposts.

== Etymology ==
{{Main|Football (word)}}
There are conflicting explanations of the origin of the word "football".  It is widely assumed that the word "football" (or the phrase "foot ball") refers to the action of the foot kicking a ball.<ref>{{cite web |title=Football |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=football&allowed_in_frame=0 |publisher=Etymology Online |accessdate=14 December 2015}}</ref>  There is an alternative explanation, which is that football originally referred to a variety of games in [[medieval Europe]], which were played ''on foot''. There is no conclusive evidence for either explanation.

The [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] are known to have played many ball games, some of which involved the use of the feet. The Roman game ''[[harpastum]]'' is believed to have been adapted from a [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] team game known as "?????????"

There are a number of references to traditional, [[ancient]], or [[prehistoric]] ball games, played by [[indigenous peoples]] in many different parts of the world. For example, in 1586, men from a ship commanded by an English explorer named [[John Davis (English explorer)|John Davis]], went ashore to play a form of football with [[Inuit]] (Eskimo) people in Greenland.<ref>Richard Hakluyt, [http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/h/hakluyt/northwest/chapter8.html Voyages in Search of The North-West Passage] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012191427/http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/h/hakluyt/northwest/chapter8.html |date=12 October 2008 }}, ''[[University of Adelaide]]'', 29 December 2003</ref> There are later accounts of an Inuit game played on ice, called ''Aqsaqtuk''. Each match began with two teams facing each other in parallel lines, before attempting to kick the ball through each other team's line and then at a goal. In 1610, [[William Strachey]], a colonist at [[Jamestown, Virginia]] recorded a game played by Native Americans, called ''Pahsaheman''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} On the [[Australian continent]] several tribes of [[indigenous Australians|indigenous people]] played kicking and catching games with stuffed balls which have been generalised by historians as ''[[Marn Grook]]'' ([[Djab Wurrung]] for "game ball"). The earliest historical account is an [[anecdote]] from the 1878 book by [[Robert Brough-Smyth]], ''The Aborigines of Victoria'', in which a man called Richard Thomas is quoted as saying, in about 1841 in [[Victoria, Australia]], that he had witnessed Aboriginal people playing the game: "Mr Thomas describes how the foremost player will drop kick a ball made from the skin of a [[Phalangeriformes|possum]] and how other players leap into the air in order to catch it." Some historians have theorised that ''Marn Grook'' was one of the [[Origins of Australian football|origins of]] [[Australian rules football]].

The [[M?ori people|M?ori]] in New Zealand played a game called [[Ki-o-rahi]] consisting of teams of seven players play on a circular field divided into zones, and score points by touching the 'pou' (boundary markers) and hitting a central 'tupu' or target.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

[[Mesoamerican ballgame|Games played in Mesoamerica]] with rubber balls by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]] are also well-documented as existing since before this time, but these had more similarities to [[basketball]] or [[volleyball]], and no links have been found between such games and modern football sports. Northeastern American Indians, especially the [[Iroquois]] Confederation, played a game which made use of net racquets to throw and catch a small ball; however, although it is a ball-goal foot game, [[lacrosse]] (as its modern descendant is called) is likewise not usually classed as a form of "football."{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

These games and others may well go far back into antiquity. However, the main sources of modern football codes appear to lie in western Europe, especially England.

The early forms of football played in England, sometimes referred to as "[[mob football]]", would be played between neighbouring towns and villages, involving an unlimited number of players on opposing teams who would clash ''en masse'',<ref>{{cite book |last=Dunning |first=Eric |title=Sport Matters: Sociological Studies of Sport, Violence and Civilisation |publisher=Routledge |year=1999 |page=89 |isbn=978-0-415-09378-1}}</ref> struggling to move an item, such as inflated animal's bladder<ref name="sportmatters">{{cite book |last=Dunning |first=Eric |title=Sport Matters: Sociological Studies of Sport, Violence and Civilisation |publisher=Routledge |year=1999 |page=88 |isbn=978-0-415-09378-1}}</ref> to particular geographical points, such as their opponents' church, with play taking place in the open space between neighbouring parishes.<ref>{{cite book |last=Baker |first=William |title=Sports in the Western World |publisher=University of Illinois Press |year=1988 |page=48 |isbn=978-0-252-06042-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rkuAiv3LoR4C }}</ref> The game was played primarily during significant religious festivals, such as Shrovetide, Christmas, or Easter,<ref name="sportmatters" /> and Shrovetide games have survived into the modern era in a number of English towns (see below).

The first detailed description of what was almost certainly football in England was given by [[William FitzStephen]] in about 1174–1183. He described the activities of London youths during the annual festival of [[Shrove Tuesday]]:
{{quote|After lunch all the youth of the city go out into the fields to take part in a ball game. The students of each school have their own ball; the workers from each city craft are also carrying their balls. Older citizens, fathers, and wealthy citizens come on horseback to watch their juniors competing, and to relive their own youth vicariously: you can see their inner passions aroused as they watch the action and get caught up in the fun being had by the carefree adolescents.<ref>Stephen Alsford, [http://www.trytel.com/~tristan/towns/florilegium/introduction/intro01.html#p25 FitzStephen's Description of London], ''Florilegium Urbanum'', April 5, 2006</ref>}}

Most of the very early references to the game speak simply of "ball play" or "playing at ball". This reinforces the idea that the games played at the time did not necessarily involve a ball being kicked.

An early reference to a ball game that was probably football comes from 1280 at [[Ulgham]], Northumberland, England:  "Henry... while playing at ball.. ran against David".<ref name=Magoun>Francis Peabody Magoun, 1929, "Football in Medieval England and Middle-English literature" (''The American Historical Review'', v. 35, No. 1).</ref>  Football was played in Ireland in 1308, with a documented reference to John McCrocan, a spectator at a "football game" at [[Newcastle, County Down]] being charged with accidentally stabbing a player named William Bernard.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.carlow-nationalist.ie/tabId/392/itemId/2418/Irish-inventions-fact-and-fiction.aspx |title=Irish inventions: fact and fiction |publisher=Carlow-nationalist.ie |date= |accessdate=16 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120729154246/http://www.carlow-nationalist.ie/tabId/392/itemId/2418/Irish-inventions-fact-and-fiction.aspx |archivedate=29 July 2012 |df=}}</ref>  Another reference to a football game comes in 1321 at [[Shouldham]], Norfolk, England: "[d]uring the game at ball as he kicked the ball, a lay friend of his... ran against him and wounded himself".<ref name="Magoun"/>

In 1314, [[Nicholas de Farndone]], [[Lord Mayor of the City of London]] issued a decree banning football in the French used by the English upper classes at the time. A translation reads: "[f]orasmuch as there is great noise in the city caused by hustling over large foot balls [''rageries de grosses pelotes de pee'']<ref>Derek Birley (Sport and The Making of Britain). 1993. Manchester University Press. p. 32. 978-0719037597</ref> in the fields of the public from which many evils might arise which God forbid: we command and forbid on behalf of the king, on pain of imprisonment, such game to be used in the city in the future." This is the earliest reference to football.

In 1363, King [[Edward III of England]] issued a proclamation banning "...handball, football, or hockey; coursing and cock-fighting, or other such idle games",<ref>Derek Baker (England in the Later Middle Ages). 1995. Boydell & Brewer. p. 187. {{ISBN|978-0-85115-648-4}}</ref> showing that "football" – whatever its exact form in this case – was being differentiated from games involving other parts of the body, such as handball.

A game known as "football" was played in Scotland as early as the 15th century: it was prohibited by the Football Act 1424 and although the law fell into disuse it was not repealed until 1906. There is evidence for schoolboys playing a "football" ball game in Aberdeen in 1633 (some references cite 1636) which is notable as an early allusion to what some have considered to be passing the ball. The word "pass" in the most recent translation is derived from "huc percute" (strike it here) and later "repercute pilam" (strike the ball again) in the original Latin. It is not certain that the ball was being struck between members of the same team. The original word translated as "goal" is "metum", literally meaning the "pillar at each end of the circus course" in a Roman chariot race. There is a reference to "get hold of the ball before [another player] does" (Praeripe illi pilam si possis agere) suggesting that handling of the ball was allowed. One sentence states in the original 1930 translation "Throw yourself against him" (Age, objice te illi).
[[File:Football gravure 1750.jpg|thumb|France circa 1750]]
King [[Henry IV of England]] also presented one of the earliest documented uses of the English word "football", in 1409, when he issued a proclamation forbidding the levying of money for "foteball".<ref name=Magoun/><ref name=Etymology>{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=football |title=Online Etymology Dictionary (no date), "football" |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=19 June 2010}}</ref>

There is also an account in [[Latin]] from the end of the 15th century of football being played at [[Cawston, Nottinghamshire]]. This is the first description of a "kicking game" and the first description of [[dribbling]]: "[t]he game at which they had met for common recreation is called by some the foot-ball game. It is one in which young men, in country sport, propel a huge ball not by throwing it into the air but by striking it and rolling it along the ground, and that not with their hands but with their feet... kicking in opposite directions" The chronicler gives the earliest reference to a football pitch, stating that: "[t]he boundaries have been marked and the game had started.<ref name=Magoun/>

Other firsts in the mediæval and [[early modern Europe|early modern]] eras:

* "a football", in the sense of a ball rather than a game, was first mentioned in 1486.<ref name=Etymology/> This reference is in Dame [[Juliana Berners]]' ''Book of [[St Albans]]''. It states: "a certain rounde instrument to play with ...it is an instrument for the foote and then it is calde in Latyn 'pila pedalis', a fotebal."<ref name=Magoun/>
* a pair of football boots were ordered by King [[Henry VIII of England]] in 1526.<ref>[http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1150460,00.html Vivek Chaudhary, "Who's the fat bloke in the number eight shirt?"] (''[[The Guardian]]'', 18 February 2004.)</ref>
* women playing a form of football was first described in 1580 by Sir [[Philip Sidney]] in one of his poems: "[a] tyme there is for all, my mother often sayes, When she, with skirts tuckt very hy, with girles at football playes."<ref>Anniina Jokinen, [http://www.luminarium.org/editions/sidneydialogue.htm Sir Philip Sidney. "A Dialogue Between Two Shepherds"] (''Luminarium.org'', July 2006)</ref>
* the first references to ''goals'' are in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. In 1584 and 1602 respectively, [[John Norden]] and [[Richard Carew (antiquary)|Richard Carew]] referred to "goals" in [[Cornish hurling]]. Carew described how goals were made: "they pitch two bushes in the ground, some eight or ten foote asunder; and directly against them, ten or twelue [twelve] score off, other twayne in like distance, which they terme their Goales".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/srvcr10.txt |title=EBook of The Survey of Cornwall |last=Richard |first=Carew |publisher=Project Gutenberg |accessdate=3 October 2007}}</ref> He is also the first to describe goalkeepers and passing of the ball between players.
* the first direct reference to ''scoring a goal'' is in [[John Day (dramatist)|John Day]]'s play ''[[The Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green]]'' (performed circa 1600; published 1659): "I'll play a gole at [[Camping (game)|camp-ball]]" (an extremely violent variety of football, which was popular in [[East Anglia]]). Similarly in a poem in 1613, [[Michael Drayton]] refers to "when the Ball to throw, And drive it to the Gole, in squadrons forth they goe".

=== Calcio Fiorentino ===
[[File:Calcio fiorentino 1688.jpg|right|thumb|An illustration of the ''Calcio Fiorentino'' field and starting positions, from a 1688 book by Pietro di Lorenzo Bini.]]
{{Main|Calcio Fiorentino}}
In the 16th century, the city of [[Florence]] celebrated the period between [[Epiphany (feast)|Epiphany]] and [[Lent]] by playing a game which today is known as "''calcio storico''" ("historic kickball") in the [[Piazza Santa Croce]]. The young aristocrats of the city would dress up in fine silk costumes and embroil themselves in a violent form of football. For example, ''calcio'' players could punch, shoulder charge, and kick opponents. Blows below the belt were allowed. The game is said to have originated as a military training exercise. In 1580, Count Giovanni de' Bardi di Vernio wrote ''Discorso sopra 'l giuoco del Calcio Fiorentino''. This is sometimes said to be the earliest code of rules for any football game. The game was not played after January 1739 (until it was revived in May 1930).

There have been many attempts to ban football, from the [[middle ages]] through to the modern day. The first such law was passed in England in 1314; it was followed by more than 30 in England alone between 1314 and 1667.<ref name="Women Football and Europe">{{cite book |isbn=9781841262253 |title=Women, Football and Europe: Histories, Equity and Experience | editor1-last = Magee | editor1-first= Jonathan |year=2007 |publisher=Meyer & Meyer Sport | editor2-last = Caudwell | editor2-first= Jayne | editor3-last = Liston | editor3-first= Kate | editor4-last = Scraton | editor4-first= Sheila |series=International Football Institute Series |volume=1 |pages=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yo2ZnpOQc7AC }}</ref>{{rp|6}} Football faced armed opposition in the 18th Century when used as a cover for violent protest against the [[enclosure act]].{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Women were banned from playing at English and Scottish Football League grounds in 1921, a ban that was only lifted in the 1970s.

== Establishment of modern codes ==

=== English public schools ===
{{Main|English public school football games}}
While football continued to be played in various forms throughout Britain, its [[public school (England)|public schools]] (equivalent to private schools in other countries) are widely credited with four key achievements in the creation of modern football codes. First of all, the evidence suggests that they were important in taking football away from its "mob" form and turning it into an organised team sport. Second, many early descriptions of football and references to it were recorded by people who had studied at these schools. Third, it was teachers, students and former students from these schools who first codified football games, to enable matches to be played between schools. Finally, it was at English public schools that the division between "kicking" and "running" (or "carrying") games first became clear.

The earliest evidence that games resembling football were being played at English public schools – mainly attended by boys from the upper, upper-middle and professional classes – comes from the ''Vulgaria'' by William Herman in 1519. Herman had been headmaster at [[Eton College|Eton]] and [[Winchester College|Winchester]] colleges and his [[Latin]] textbook includes a translation exercise with the phrase "We wyll playe with a ball full of wynde".<ref>A history of Winchester College. by Arthur F Leach. Duckworth, 1899 {{ISBN|1-4446-5884-0}}</ref>

[[Richard Mulcaster]], a student at [[Eton College]] in the early 16th century and later headmaster at other English schools, has been described as "the greatest sixteenth Century advocate of football".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.footballnetwork.org/dev/historyoffootball/history8_18_3.asp |title=2003, "Richard Mulcaster" |publisher=Footballnetwork.org |date= |accessdate=19 June 2010}}</ref> Among his contributions are the earliest evidence of organised team football. Mulcaster's writings refer to teams ("sides" and "parties"), positions ("standings"), a referee ("judge over the parties") and a coach "(trayning maister)". Mulcaster's "footeball" had evolved from the disordered and violent forms of traditional football:

{{quote|[s]ome smaller number with such overlooking, sorted into sides and standings, not meeting with their bodies so boisterously to trie their strength: nor shouldring or shuffing one an other so barbarously ... may use footeball for as much good to the body, by the chiefe use of the legges.<ref>

In 1633, [[David Wedderburn (writer)|David Wedderburn]], a teacher from [[Aberdeen]], mentioned elements of modern football games in a short [[Latin]] textbook called ''Vocabula.'' Wedderburn refers to what has been translated into modern English as "keeping goal" and makes an allusion to passing the ball ("strike it here"). There is a reference to "get hold of the ball", suggesting that some handling was allowed. It is clear that the tackles allowed included the charging and holding of opposing players ("drive that man back").<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Shared Origins of Football, Rugby, and Soccer |last=Rowley |first=Christopher |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |year=2015 |isbn=9781442246195 |location= |pages=86 |via=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HmBoCgAAQBAJ }}</ref>

A more detailed description of football is given in [[Francis Willughby]]'s ''Book of Games'', written in about 1660.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P-io9DcBllkC&pg=PA168&lpg=PA168&vq=football&dq=willughby+book+of+sports |title=Francis Willughby, 1660–72, '&#39;Book of Games'&#39; |publisher= |date= |accessdate=19 June 2010 |isbn=978-1-85928-460-5 |year=2003}}</ref> Willughby, who had studied at [[Bishop Vesey's Grammar School]], [[Sutton Coldfield]], is the first to describe goals and a distinct playing field: "a close that has a gate at either end. The gates are called Goals." His book includes a diagram illustrating a football field. He also mentions tactics ("leaving some of their best players to guard the goal"); scoring ("they that can strike the ball through their opponents' goal first win") and the way teams were selected ("the players being equally divided according to their strength and nimbleness"). He is the first to describe a "law" of football: "they must not strike [an opponent's leg] higher than the ball".{{Citation needed|date=June 2009|reason=For all the quotes in this paragraph}}

English public schools were the first to codify football games. In particular, they devised the first ''[[offside (sport)|offside]]'' rules, during the late 18th century.<ref name=Carosi>[http://www.kenaston.org/download/KenAstonRefereeSociety/offside_history-JulianCarosi.pdf Julian Carosi, 2006, "The History of Offside"]</ref> In the earliest manifestations of these rules, players were "off their side" if they simply stood between the ball and the goal which was their objective. Players were not allowed to pass the ball forward, either by foot or by hand. They could only dribble with their feet, or advance the ball in a ''[[Scrum (rugby)|scrum]]'' or similar ''formation''. However, offside laws began to diverge and develop differently at each school, as is shown by the rules of football from Winchester, [[Rugby School|Rugby]], [[Harrow School|Harrow]] and [[Cheltenham School|Cheltenham]], during between 1810 and 1850.<ref name=Carosi/> The first known codes – in the sense of a set of rules – were those of Eton in 1815 <ref name="Richard William Cox 2002 243">{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of British Football |first=Richard William |last=Cox |first2=Dave |last2=Russell |first3=Wray |last3=Vamplew |publisher=Routledge |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-7146-5249-8 |page=243|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JKbb02bg6zYC }}</ref> and [[Aldenham]] in 1825.<ref name="Richard William Cox 2002 243"/>)

During the early 19th century, most working class people in Britain had to work six days a week, often for over twelve hours a day. They had neither the time nor the inclination to engage in sport for recreation and, at the time, many [[Child labour#Industrial Revolution|children were part of the labour force]]. [[Feast day]] football played on the streets was in decline. Public school boys, who enjoyed some freedom from work, became the inventors of organised football games with formal codes of rules.

Football was adopted by a number of public schools as a way of encouraging competitiveness and keeping youths fit. Each school drafted its own rules, which varied widely between different schools and were changed over time with each new intake of pupils. Two schools of thought developed regarding rules. Some schools favoured a game in which the ball could be carried (as at Rugby, [[Marlborough College|Marlborough]] and Cheltenham), while others preferred a game where kicking and dribbling the ball was promoted (as at Eton, Harrow, [[Westminster School|Westminster]] and [[Charterhouse School|Charterhouse]]). The division into these two camps was partly the result of circumstances in which the games were played. For example, Charterhouse and Westminster at the time had restricted playing areas; the boys were confined to playing their ball game within the school [[cloisters]], making it difficult for them to adopt rough and tumble running games.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009|reason=For the whole paragraph}}

[[File:Rugby School 850.jpg|thumb|left|[[Rugby School]] ]] [[William Webb Ellis]], a pupil at Rugby School, is said to have "with a fine disregard for the rules of football, ''as played in his time'' [emphasis added], first took the ball in his arms and ran with it, thus creating the distinctive feature of the rugby game." in 1823. This act is usually said to be the beginning of Rugby football, but there is little evidence that it occurred, and most sports historians believe the story to be apocryphal. The act of 'taking the ball in his arms' is often misinterpreted as 'picking the ball up' as it is widely believed that Webb Ellis' 'crime' was handling the ball, as in modern soccer, however handling the ball at the time was often permitted and in some cases compulsory,<ref>example of ball handling in early football from English writer [[William Hone]], writing in 1825 or 1826, quotes the social commentator Sir [[Frederick Morton Eden]], regarding "Foot-Ball", as played at [[Scone, Scotland|]], Scotland:
:''The game was this: he who at any time got the ball into his hands, run [sic] with it till overtaken by one of the opposite part; and then, if he could shake himself loose from those on the opposite side who seized him, he run on; if not, he threw the ball from him, unless it was wrested from him by the other party'', but no person was allowed to kick it. ([http://www.uab.edu/english/hone/etexts/edb/day-pages/046-february15.html William Hone, 1825–26, ''The Every-Day Book'', "February 15."] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080105043230/http://www.uab.edu/english/hone/etexts/edb/day-pages/046-february15.html |date=5 January 2008 }} Access date: 15 March 2007.)</ref> the rule for which Webb Ellis showed disregard was ''running forward with it'' as the rules of his time only allowed a player to retreat backwards or kick forwards.

[[Railway Mania|The boom in rail transport in Britain]] during the 1840s meant that people were able to travel further and with less inconvenience than they ever had before. Inter-school sporting competitions became possible. However, it was difficult for schools to play each other at football, as each school played by its own rules. The solution to this problem was usually that the match be divided into two halves, one half played by the rules of the host "home" school, and the other half by the visiting "away" school.

The ''modern'' rules of many football codes were formulated during the mid- or late- 19th century. This also applies to other sports such as lawn bowls, lawn tennis, etc. The major impetus for this was the patenting of the world's first [[lawnmower]] in 1830. This allowed for the preparation of modern ovals, playing fields, pitches, grass courts, etc.<ref>ABC Radio National ''Ockham's Razor'', first broadcast 6 June 2010.</ref>

Apart from Rugby football, the public school codes have barely been played beyond the confines of each school's playing fields. However, many of them are still played at the schools which created them (see [[Football#Surviving UK school games|Surviving UK school games]] below).

Public schools' dominance of sports in the UK began to wane after the [[Factory Act 1850|''Factory Act'' of 1850]], which significantly increased the recreation time available to working class children. Before 1850, many British children had to work six days a week, for more than twelve hours a day. From 1850, they could not work before 6&nbsp;a.m. (7&nbsp;a.m. in winter) or after 6&nbsp;p.m. on weekdays (7&nbsp;p.m. in winter); on Saturdays they had to cease work at 2&nbsp;p.m. These changes meant that working class children had more time for games, including various forms of football.

==== Clubs ====
{{Main|Oldest football clubs}}

Sports clubs dedicated to playing football began in the 18th century, for example [[The Gymnastic Society|London's Gymnastic Society]] which was founded in the mid-18th century and ceased playing matches in 1796.<ref>THE SURREY CLUB Bell's Life in London and Sporting Chronicle (London, England), Sunday, 7 October 1849; pg. 6. New Readerships</ref><ref>Football: The First Hundred Years. The Untold Story. Adrian Harvey. 2005. Routledge, London</ref>

The first documented club to bear in the title a reference to being a 'football club' were called "The Foot-Ball Club" who were located in [[Edinburgh]], Scotland, during the period 1824–41.<ref>John Hope, ''Accounts and papers of the football club kept by John Hope, WS, and some Hope Correspondence 1787–1886'' (National Archives of Scotland, GD253/183)</ref><ref name="Nas.gov.uk">{{cite web |url=http://www.nas.gov.uk/about/071112.asp |title=The Foot-Ball Club in Edinburgh, 1824–1841 – The National Archives of Scotland |publisher=Nas.gov.uk |date=13 November 2007 |accessdate=19 June 2010}}</ref>  The club forbade tripping but allowed pushing and holding and the picking up of the ball.<ref name="Nas.gov.uk"/>

In 1845, three boys at Rugby school were tasked with codifying the rules then being used at the school. These were the first set of written rules (or code) for any form of football.<ref>{{cite web |title=Rugby chronology |work=Museum of Rugby |url=http://www.rfu.com/microsites/museum/page.aspx?section=89&sectionTitle=World+Rugby+Chronology |accessdate=24 April 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121094425/http://www.rfu.com/microsites/museum/page.aspx?section=89&sectionTitle=World%2BRugby%2BChronology |archivedate=21 November 2008 |df=}}</ref> This further assisted the spread of the Rugby game.

==== Competitions ====
{{Main|Oldest football competitions}}

One of the longest running football fixture is the [[Cordner-Eggleston Cup]], contested between [[Melbourne Grammar School]] and [[Scotch College, Melbourne]] every year since 1858. It is believed by many to also be the first match of [[Australian rules football]], although it was played under experimental rules in its first year. The first football trophy tournament was the Caledonian Challenge Cup, donated by the Royal [[Caledonians|Caledonian]] Society of Melbourne, played in 1861 under the [[Melbourne Rules]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.electricscotland.com/history/australia/melbourne.htm |title=History of the Royal Caledonian Society of Melbourne |publisher=Electricscotland.com |date= |accessdate=19 June 2010}}</ref>  The oldest football league is a rugby football competition, the [[United Hospitals Challenge Cup]] (1874), while the oldest rugby trophy is the [[Yorkshire Cup (rugby union)|Yorkshire Cup]], contested since 1878. The [[South Australian Football Association]] (30 April 1877) is the oldest surviving Australian rules football competition. The oldest surviving soccer trophy is the [[Youdan Cup]] (1867) and the oldest national football competition is the English FA Cup (1871).   [[The Football League]] (1888) is recognised as the longest running Association Football league. The [[England v Scotland (1870)|first ''ever'' international football match]] took place between sides representing England and Scotland on 5 March 1870 at [[the Oval]] under the authority of the FA. The first Rugby international took place in 1871.

{{Main|Football (ball)}}

[[File:Richard Lindon (1816-1887).jpg|upright|thumb|[[Richard Lindon]] (seen in 1880) is believed to have invented the first footballs with rubber bladders.]] In Europe, early footballs were made out of animal [[urinary bladder|bladders]], more specifically [[Pig bladder|pig's bladders]], which were inflated. Later leather coverings were introduced to allow the balls to keep their shape.<ref>[http://www.soccerballworld.com/History.htm#Early Soccer Ball World – Early History].

Richard Lindon's wife is said to have died of lung disease caused by blowing up pig's bladders.<ref>The exact name of Mr Lindon is in dispute, as well as the exact timing of the creation of the inflatable bladder. It is known that he created this for both association and rugby footballs. However, sites devoted to football indicate he was known as [https://web.archive.org/web/20070311213720/http://www.richardlindon.com/ HJ Lindon], who was actually Richard Lindon's son, and created the ball in 1862 (ref: [http://www.soccerballworld.com/History.htm Soccer Ball World]), whereas rugby sites refer to him as [[Richard Lindon]] creating the ball in 1870 (ref: [http://observer.guardian.co.uk/osm/story/0,,1699545,00.html Guardian article]). Both agree that his wife died when inflating pig's bladders. This information originated from web sites which may be unreliable, and the answer may only be found in researching books in central libraries.</ref> Lindon also won medals for the invention of the "Rubber inflatable Bladder" and the "Brass Hand Pump".

In 1855, the U.S. inventor [[Charles Goodyear]] – who had patented [[vulcanized rubber|vulcanised rubber]] – exhibited a spherical football, with an exterior of vulcanised rubber panels, at the [[Exposition Universelle (1855)|Paris ''Exhibition Universelle'']]. The ball was to prove popular in early forms of football in the U.S.A.<ref>[http://www.soccerballworld.com/Oldestball.htm soccerballworld.com, (no date) "Charles Goodyear's Soccer Ball"] Downloaded 30/11/06.</ref>

The iconic ball with a regular pattern of hexagons and pentagons (see [[truncated icosahedron]]) did not become popular until the 1960s, and was first used in the World Cup [[1970 FIFA World Cup|in 1970]].

==== Modern ball passing tactics ====
{{Main|Passing (association football)}}

The earliest reference to a game of football involving players passing the ball and attempting to score past a goalkeeper was written in 1633 by David Wedderburn, a poet and teacher in [[Aberdeen]], Scotland.<ref>[http://www.scotsman.com/news/scottish-news/edinburgh-east-fife/scots_invented_beautiful_game_1_1121849 Scots invented beautiful game] The Scotsman, 14 June 2006</ref>  Nevertheless, the original text does not state whether the allusion to passing as 'kick the ball back' ('Repercute pilam') was in a forward or backward direction or between members of the same opposing teams (as was usual at this time)<ref>Magoun, Francis Peabody (1938).

=== Cambridge rules ===
{{Main|Cambridge rules}}
In 1848, at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]], [[H. de Winton]] and [[J. C. Thring]], who were both formerly at [[Shrewsbury School]], called a meeting at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], with 12 other representatives from Eton, Harrow, Rugby, [[Winchester College|Winchester]] and Shrewsbury. An eight-hour meeting produced what amounted to the first set of modern rules, known as the ''Cambridge rules''. No copy of these rules now exists, but a revised version from circa 1856 is held in the library of Shrewsbury School.<ref>
{{cite web |title=Football Association tribute to the Cambridge Rules |url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/news/football-association-tribute-to-the-cambridge-rules |accessdate=5 January 2015}}
</ref> The rules clearly favour the kicking game. Handling was only allowed ''when a player catches the ball directly from the foot'' entitling them to a free kick and there was a primitive offside rule, disallowing players from "loitering" around the opponents' goal. The Cambridge rules were not widely adopted outside English public schools and universities (but it was arguably the most significant influence on [[the Football Association]] committee members responsible for formulating the rules of Association football).

=== Sheffield rules ===
{{Main|Sheffield rules}}
By the late 1850s, many football clubs had been formed throughout the English-speaking world, to play various codes of football. [[Sheffield F.C.|Sheffield Football Club]], founded in 1857 in the English city of [[Sheffield]] by Nathaniel Creswick and William Prest, was later recognised as the world's oldest club playing association football.<ref name="Football, the First Hundred Years">{{cite book |first=Adrian |last=Harvey |title=Football, the First Hundred Years |year=2005 |pages=95–99 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-35019-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TxoZ0S-GC7MC}}</ref>
However, the club initially played its own code of football: the ''Sheffield rules''. The code was largely independent of the public school rules, the most significant difference being the lack of an ''offside'' rule.

The code was responsible for many innovations that later spread to association football. These included [[wikt:free kick|free kick]]s, [[corner kick]]s, handball, [[throw-in]]s and the crossbar.<ref>{{cite book |first=Brendan |last=Murphy |title=From Sheffield with Love |year=2007 |pages=41–43 |publisher=Sports Book Limited |isbn=978-1-899807-56-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D9PVkQEACAAJ }}</ref> By the 1870s they became the dominant code in the north and midlands of England. At this time a series of rule changes by both the [[The Football Association|London]] and [[Sheffield and Hallamshire County Football Association|Sheffield]] FAs gradually eroded the differences between the two games until the adoption of a common code in 1877.

=== Australian rules ===

[[File:Tom Wills 1857.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Tom Wills]], widely regarded as the father of Australian football]]
There is archival evidence of "foot-ball" games being played in various parts of Australia throughout the first half of the 19th century. The origins of an organised game of football known today as Australian rules football can be traced back to 1858 in [[Melbourne]], the capital city of [[Victoria (state)|Victoria]].

In July 1858, [[Tom Wills]], an Australian-born cricketer educated at [[Rugby School]] in England, wrote a letter to ''[[Bell's Life in Victoria|Bell's Life in Victoria & Sporting Chronicle]]'', calling for a "foot-ball club" with a "code of laws" to keep cricketers fit during winter.<ref>{{cite web |title=Letter from Tom Wills |work=MCG website |url=http://www.mcg.org.au/default.asp?pg=footballdisplay&articleid=37 |accessdate=14 July 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060625081726/http://www.mcg.org.au/default.asp?pg=footballdisplay&articleid=37 |archivedate=25 June 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=}}</ref> This is considered by historians to be a defining moment in the creation of Australian rules football.

One week later, Wills umpired a schoolboys match between [[Melbourne Grammar School]] and [[Scotch College (Melbourne)|Scotch College]]. Following these matches, organised football in Melbourne rapidly increased in popularity.

[[File:Australianfootball1866.jpg|thumb|Wood engraving of an Australian rules football match at the [[Yarra Park|Richmond Paddock]], [[Melbourne]], 1866]]
Wills and others involved in these early matches formed the [[Melbourne Football Club]] (the oldest surviving Australian football club) on 14 May 1859. Club members Wills, [[William Hammersley]], [[J. B. Thompson]] and [[Thomas H. Smith]] met with the intention of forming a set of rules that would be widely adopted by other clubs. The committee debated rules used in English public school games; Wills pushed for various [[rugby football]] rules he learnt during his schooling. The first rules share similarities with these games, and were shaped to suit to Australian conditions. [[H. C. A. Harrison]], a seminal figure in Australian football, recalled that his cousin Wills wanted "a game of our own".<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Hibbins |first1=Gillian |last2=Mancini |first2=Anne |title=Running with the Ball: Football's Foster Father |publisher=Lynedoch Publications |year=1987 |pages=118–119 |isbn=978-0-7316-0481-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oR3wAAAAMAAJ }}</ref> The code was distinctive in the prevalence of the [[Mark (Australian football)|mark]], [[Free kick (Australian rules football)|free kick]], [[Tackle (football move)#Australian rules football|tackling]], lack of an offside rule and that players were specifically penalised for [[Handball (Australian rules football)|throwing the ball]].

The Melbourne football rules were widely distributed and gradually adopted by the other Victorian clubs. The rules were updated several times during the 1860s to accommodate the rules of other influential Victorian football clubs. A significant redraft in 1866 by H. C. A. Harrison's committee accommodated the [[Geelong Football Club]]'s rules, making the game then known as "Victorian Rules" increasingly distinct from other codes. It soon adopted cricket fields and an oval ball, used specialised goal and behind posts, and featured [[running bounce|bouncing the ball while running]] and [[specky|spectacular high marking]]. The game spread quickly to other [[Australian states and territories|Australian colonies]]. Outside its heartland in southern Australia, the code experienced a significant period of decline following World War I but has since grown throughout Australia and in [[Australian football around the world|other parts of the world]], and the [[Australian Football League]] emerged as the dominant professional competition.

During the early 1860s, there were increasing attempts in England to unify and reconcile the various public school games. In 1862, J. C. Thring, who had been one of the driving forces behind the original Cambridge Rules, was a master at [[Uppingham School]] and he issued his own rules of what he called "The Simplest Game" (these are also known as the Uppingham Rules). In early October 1863 another new revised version of the Cambridge Rules was drawn up by a seven member committee representing former pupils from Harrow, Shrewsbury, Eton, Rugby, Marlborough and Westminster.

At the [[Freemasons' Tavern]], Great Queen Street, London on the evening of 26 October 1863, representatives of several football clubs in the [[County of London|London Metropolitan area]] met for the inaugural meeting of [[The Football Association]] (FA). The aim of the Association was to establish a single unifying code and regulate the playing of the game among its members. Following the first meeting, the public schools were invited to join the association. All of them declined, except Charterhouse and Uppingham. In total, six meetings of the FA were held between October and December 1863. After the third meeting, a draft set of rules were published. However, at the beginning of the fourth meeting, attention was drawn to the recently published Cambridge Rules of 1863. The Cambridge rules differed from the draft FA rules in two significant areas; namely running with (carrying) the ball and [[hacking (rugby)|hacking]] (kicking opposing players in the shins). The two contentious FA rules were as follows:

{{quote|IX. A player shall be entitled to run with the ball towards his adversaries' goal if he makes a fair catch, or catches the ball on the first bound; but in case of a fair catch, if he makes his mark he shall not run.<br /><!--Leave it here: two rules, two lines. -->
X. If any player shall run with the ball towards his adversaries' goal, any player on the opposite side shall be at liberty to charge, hold, trip or hack him, or to wrest the ball from him, but no player shall be held and hacked at the same time.<ref>Peter Shortell. [http://clubs.rfu.com/Clubs/portals/cornwallreferees/ThoughtsforRefs6667.aspx  Hacking – a history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080403122555/http://clubs.rfu.com/Clubs/portals/cornwallreferees/ThoughtsforRefs6667.aspx |date=2008-04-03 }}, [http://clubs.rfu.com/Clubs/portals/cornwallreferees/CRRSHistory6515.aspx Cornwall Referees Society]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080303044805/http://clubs.rfu.com/Clubs/portals/cornwallreferees/CRRSHistory6515.aspx |date=3 March 2008 }}, 2 October 2006</ref>}}

At the fifth meeting it was proposed that these two rules be removed. Most of the delegates supported this, but [[F. M. Campbell]], the representative from [[Blackheath Rugby Club|Blackheath]] and the first FA treasurer, objected. He said: "hacking is the true football". However, the motion to ban running with the ball in hand and hacking was carried and Blackheath withdrew from the FA. After the final meeting on 8 December, the FA published the "[[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of Football]]", the first comprehensive set of rules for the game later known as Association Football. The term "soccer", in use since the late 19th century, derives from an [[Oxford "-er"|Oxford University abbreviation]] of "Association".<ref name=OEDsoccer>{{cite journal |date=June 2011 |title=soccer, n |journal=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |volume= |issue= |pages= |url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/183733 |accessdate=1 July 2011}}</ref>

The first FA rules still contained elements that are no longer part of association football, but which are still recognisable in other games (such as Australian football and rugby football): for instance, a player could make a fair catch and claim a ''[[Mark (Australian football)|mark]]'', which entitled him to a free kick; and if a player touched the ball behind the opponents' goal line, his side was entitled to a ''free kick'' at goal, from 15&nbsp;yards (13.5&nbsp;metres) in front of the goal line.

=== Rugby football ===
{{Main|History of rugby union}}
[[File:Football London Ilustrated News.gif|thumb|A rugby scrum in 1871]]
In [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], by 1870, there were about 75 clubs playing variations of the Rugby school game. There were also "rugby" clubs in Ireland, Australia, Canada and New Zealand. However, there was no generally accepted set of rules for rugby until 1871, when 21 clubs from London came together to form the [[Rugby Football Union]] (RFU). The first official RFU rules were adopted in June 1871. These rules allowed passing the ball. They also included the [[try]], where touching the ball over the line allowed an attempt at goal, though drop-goals from marks and general play, and penalty conversions were still the main form of contest.

=== North American football codes ===
{{Main|History of American football|Canadian football#History}}

As was the case in Britain, by the early 19th century, North American schools and universities played their own local games, between sides made up of students. For example, students at [[Dartmouth College]] in [[New Hampshire]] played a game called [[Old division football]], a variant of the association football codes, as early as the 1820s.<ref name=ODF>{{cite web |last=Meacham |first=Scott |title=Old Division Football, The Indigenous Mob Soccer Of Dartmouth College (pdf) |publisher=dartmo.com |year=2006 |url=http://www.dartmo.com/football/Football_Meacham.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=16 May 2007}}</ref> They remained largely "[[mob football]]" style games, with huge numbers of players attempting to advance the ball into a goal area, often by any means necessary. Rules were simple, violence and injury were common.<ref name=PFRA1>{{cite web |title=No Christian End! |work=The Journey to Camp: The Origins of American Football to 1889 |publisher=Professional Football Researchers Association |url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Articles/No_Christian_End.pdf |accessdate=26 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611173624/https://www.profootballresearchers.org/Articles/No_Christian_End.pdf |archivedate=11 June 2014 |df=}}</ref> The violence of these mob-style games led to widespread protests and a decision to abandon them. [[Yale University]], under pressure from the city of [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], banned the play of all forms of football in 1860, while [[Harvard University]] followed suit in 1861.<ref name=PFRA1/> In its place, two general types of football evolved: "kicking" games and "running" (or "carrying") games. A hybrid of the two, known as the "[[Boston Game|Boston game]]", was played by a group known as the [[Oneida Football Club]]. The club, considered by some historians as the first formal [[football club]] in the United States, was formed in 1862 by schoolboys who played the "Boston game" on [[Boston Common]].<ref name=PFRA1/><ref>{{cite web |last=Allaway |first=Roger |title=Were the Oneidas playing soccer or not? |work=The USA Soccer History Archives |publisher=Dave Litterer |year=2001 |url=http://www.sover.net/~spectrum/oneidas.html |accessdate=15 May 2007}}</ref> The game began to return to American college campuses by the late 1860s. The universities of Yale, [[Princeton University|Princeton]] (then known as the College of New Jersey), [[Rutgers University|Rutgers]], and [[Brown University|Brown]] all began playing "kicking" games during this time. In 1867, Princeton used rules based on those of the English [[The Football Association|Football Association]].<ref name=PFRA1/>

In Canada, the first documented football match was a practice game played on 9 November 1861, at [[University College, University of Toronto]] (approximately 400 yards west of Queen's Park). One of the participants in the game involving University of Toronto students was (Sir) William Mulock, later Chancellor of the school.<ref name=1860s>{{cite web |url=https://www.cfl.ca/page/his_timeline_1860 |work=Official Site of the Canadian Football League |title=Timeline 1860s |publisher=Canadian Football League |accessdate=13 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100501160230/http://www.cfl.ca/page/his_timeline_1860 |archivedate=1 May 2010 |df=}}</ref>  In 1864, at [[University of Trinity College|Trinity College]], Toronto, F.

On 6 November 1869, Rutgers faced Princeton in a game that was played with a round ball and, like all early games, used improvised rules. It is usually regarded as [[1869 New Jersey vs. Rutgers football game|the first game of American intercollegiate football]].<ref name=PFRA1/><ref>{{cite web |title=1800s |work=Rutgers Through The Years |publisher=Rutgers University |url=http://ruweb.rutgers.edu/timeline/1800.htm |accessdate=16 May 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070120202924/http://ruweb.rutgers.edu/timeline/1800.htm |archivedate=20 January 2007 |df=}}</ref>

Modern North American football grew out of a match between [[McGill University]] of Montreal and Harvard University in 1874. During the game, the two teams alternated between the rugby-based rules used by McGill and the Boston Game rules used by Harvard.<ref>{{cite web |title=No Christian End!

[[File:1882RutgersFootballTeam.jpg|thumb|left|Rutgers College Football Team, 1882]]
In 1880, Yale coach [[Walter Camp]], who had become a fixture at the Massasoit House conventions where the rules were debated and changed, devised a number of major innovations. Camp's two most important rule changes that diverged the American game from rugby were replacing the [[Scrum (rugby)|scrummage]] with the ''[[line of scrimmage]]'' and the establishment of the ''[[Down (American and Canadian football)|down-and-distance]]'' rules.<ref name=PFRA2/> American football still however remained a violent sport where collisions often led to serious injuries and sometimes even death.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bennett |first=Tom |title=The Pro Style: The Complete Guide to Understanding National Football League Strategy |publisher=National Football League Properties, Inc., Creative Services Division |location=Los Angeles |year=1976 |page=20}}</ref> This led U.S. President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] to hold a meeting with football representatives from Harvard, Yale, and Princeton on 9 October 1905, urging them to make drastic changes.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Tiny Maxwell and the Crisis of 1905: The Making of a Gridiron Myth |journal=College Football Historical Society |volume= |issue= |year=2001 |pages=54–57 |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/NASSH_Proceedings/NP2001/NP2001zn.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100808041801/http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/NASSH_Proceedings/NP2001/NP2001zn.pdf |deadurl=yes |archive-date=8 August 2010 |authors=Watterson, John}}</ref> One rule change introduced in 1906, devised to open up the game and reduce injury, was the introduction of the legal [[forward pass]].

Over the years, Canada absorbed some of the developments in American football in an effort to distinguish it from a more rugby-oriented game. In 1903, the [[Ontario Rugby Football Union]] adopted the [[Burnside rules]], which implemented the ''line of scrimmage'' and ''down-and-distance'' system from American football, among others.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://greycup.cfl.ca/page/grey-cup-history-timeline-1900 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=18 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120922201718/http://greycup.cfl.ca/page/grey-cup-history-timeline-1900 |archivedate=22 September 2012 |df=}} History of the Grey Cup</ref> Canadian football then implemented the legal forward pass in 1929.<ref>[https://www.cfl.ca/page/his_timeline_1920 CFL.ca History, Timeline, 1920] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100625000000/http://www.cfl.ca/page/his_timeline_1920 |date=25 June 2010 }}</ref> American and Canadian football [[Comparison of American and Canadian football|remain different codes]], stemming from rule changes that the American side of the border adopted but the Canadian side has not.

=== Gaelic football ===
[[File:Croke Park from the hill.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|All-Ireland Football Final]] in [[Croke Park]], 2004.]]
{{Main|Gaelic football#History|l1=History of Gaelic football}}
In the mid-19th century, various traditional football games, referred to collectively as ''[[caid (sport)|caid]]'', remained popular in Ireland, especially in [[County Kerry]]. One observer, Father W. Ferris, described two main forms of ''caid'' during this period: the "field game" in which the object was to put the ball through arch-like goals, formed from the boughs of two trees; and the epic "cross-country game" which took up most of the daylight hours of a Sunday on which it was played, and was won by one team taking the ball across a parish boundary. "Wrestling", "holding" opposing players, and carrying the ball were all allowed.

By the 1870s, Rugby and Association football had started to become popular in Ireland. [[Trinity College, Dublin]] was an early stronghold of Rugby (see the [[Football#Other developments in the 1850s|Developments in the 1850s]] section, above). The rules of the English FA were being distributed widely. Traditional forms of ''caid'' had begun to give way to a "rough-and-tumble game" which allowed tripping.

There was no serious attempt to unify and codify Irish varieties of football, until the establishment of the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] (GAA) in 1884. The GAA sought to promote traditional Irish sports, such as [[hurling]] and to reject imported games like Rugby and Association football. The first Gaelic football rules were drawn up by [[Maurice Davin]] and published in the ''United Ireland'' magazine on 7 February 1887. Davin's rules showed the influence of games such as hurling and a desire to formalise a distinctly Irish code of football. The prime example of this differentiation was the lack of an offside rule (an attribute which, for many years, was shared only by other Irish games like hurling, and by Australian rules football).

===  Schism in Rugby football ===
[[File:Reverend marshall.jpg|thumb|An English cartoon from the 1890s lampooning the divide in rugby football which led to the formation of [[rugby league]]. The caricatures are of Rev. Frank Marshall, an arch-opponent of player payments, and James Miller, a long-time opponent of Marshall. The caption reads:

Marshall: "Oh, fie, go away naughty boy, I don't play with boys who can’t afford to take a holiday for football any day they like!"

Miller: "Yes, that's just you to a T; you’d make it so that no lad whose father wasn’t a millionaire could play at all in a really good team. For my part I see no reason why the men who make the money shouldn’t have a share in the spending of it."]]
{{Further|History of rugby league}}
The [[International Rugby Board|International Rugby Football Board]] (IRFB) was founded in 1886, but rifts were beginning to emerge in the code. [[professional sports|Professionalism]] had already begun to creep into the various codes of football.

In England, by the 1890s, a long-standing [[Rugby Football Union]] ban on ''professional'' players was causing regional tensions within rugby football, as many players in northern England were working class and could not afford to take time off to train, travel, play and recover from injuries. This was not very different from what had occurred ten years earlier in soccer in Northern England but the authorities reacted very differently in the RFU, attempting to alienate the working class support in Northern England. In 1895, following a dispute about a player being paid broken time payments, which replaced wages lost as a result of playing rugby, representatives of the northern clubs met in [[Huddersfield]] to form the [[Rugby Football League|Northern Rugby Football Union]] (NRFU). The new body initially permitted only various types of player wage replacements. However, within two years, NRFU players could be paid, but they were required to have a job outside sport.

The demands of a professional league dictated that rugby had to become a better "spectator" sport. Within a few years the NRFU rules had started to diverge from the RFU, most notably with the abolition of the ''[[line-out (rugby union)|line-out]]''. This was followed by the replacement of the ''[[Playing rugby union#Ruck|ruck]]'' with the "play-the-ball ruck", which allowed a two-player ruck contest between the tackler at marker and the player tackled. ''[[Rugby union gameplay#Maul|Mauls]]'' were stopped once the ball carrier was held, being replaced by a play-the ball-ruck. The separate Lancashire and Yorkshire competitions of the NRFU merged in 1901, forming the ''Northern Rugby League'', the first time the name [[rugby league]] was used officially in England.

Over time, the RFU form of rugby, played by clubs which remained members of national federations affiliated to the IRFB, became known as [[rugby union]].

=== Globalisation of association football ===
{{Main|History of FIFA}}
The need for a single body to oversee association football had become apparent by the beginning of the 20th century, with the increasing popularity of international fixtures. The English Football Association had chaired many discussions on setting up an international body, but was perceived as making no progress. It fell to associations from seven other European countries: France, Belgium, Denmark, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland, to form an international association. The ''Fédération Internationale de Football Association'' ([[FIFA]]) was founded in Paris on 21 May 1904. Its first president was [[Robert Guérin]]. The French name and acronym has remained, even outside French-speaking countries.

=== Further divergence of the two rugby codes ===
Rugby league rules diverged significantly from rugby union in 1906, with the reduction of the team from 15 to 13 players. In 1907, a New Zealand professional rugby team toured Australia and Britain, receiving an enthusiastic response, and professional [[rugby league in Australia|rugby leagues were launched in Australia]] the following year. However, the rules of professional games varied from one country to another, and negotiations between various national bodies were required to fix the exact rules for each international match. This situation endured until 1948, when at the instigation of the French league, the [[Rugby League International Federation]] (RLIF) was formed at a meeting in [[Bordeaux]].

During the second half of the 20th century, the rules changed further. In 1966, rugby league officials borrowed the American football concept of ''[[Down (football)|downs]]'': a team was allowed to retain possession of the ball for four tackles (rugby union retains the original rule that a player who is tackled and brought to the ground must release the ball immediately).  The maximum number of tackles was later increased to six (in 1971), and in rugby league this became known as the [[Playing rugby league#Six tackle rule|''six tackle rule'']].

With the advent of full-time professionals in the early 1990s, and the consequent speeding up of the game, the five metre off-side distance between the two teams became 10&nbsp;metres, and the replacement rule was superseded by various interchange rules, among other changes.

The laws of rugby union also changed during the 20th century, although less significantly than those of rugby league. In particular, goals from ''[[mark (rugby)|marks]]'' were abolished, kicks directly ''[[Touch (rugby)|into touch]]'' from outside the ''[[Rugby pitch|22 metre]]'' line were penalised, new laws were put in place to determine who had possession following an inconclusive ''[[Ruck (Rugby union)|ruck]]'' or ''[[Rugby union gameplay#Maul|maul]]'', and the lifting of players in ''[[line-out (rugby union)|line-out]]s'' was legalised.

In 1995, rugby union became an "open" game, that is one which allowed professional players.<ref>{{cite web |title=History of the RFU |url=http://www.rfu.com/AboutTheRFU/History.aspx |work=[[Rugby Football Union|RFU]] |accessdate=28 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100422210444/http://www.rfu.com/AboutTheRFU/History.aspx |archivedate=22 April 2010}}</ref> Although the original dispute between the two codes has now disappeared – and despite the fact that officials from both forms of rugby football have sometimes mentioned the possibility of re-unification – the rules of both codes and their culture have diverged to such an extent that such an event is unlikely in the foreseeable future.

== Use of the word "football" ==
{{details|Football (word)}}
The word ''football'', when used in reference to a specific game can mean any one of those described above. Because of this, much friendly controversy has occurred over the term ''football'', primarily because it is used in different ways in different parts of the [[English-speaking world]]. Most often, the word "football" is used to refer to the code of football that is considered dominant within a particular region. So, effectively, what the word "football" means usually depends on where one says it.
[[File:The Sportsman 1910-11-25 Football.png|thumb|Heading from The Sportsman (London) front page of 25 November 1910, illustrating the continued use of the word "football" to encompass both association football and rugby]]
In each of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada, one football code is known solely as "football", while the others generally require a qualifier. In New Zealand, "football" historically referred to [[rugby union]], but more recently may be used unqualified to refer to association football. The sport meant by the word "football" in Australia is either [[Australian rules football]] or [[rugby league]], depending on local popularity (which largely conforms to the [[Barassi Line]]).
